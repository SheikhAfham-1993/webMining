Nothing of the game was created by own ideas, people who already played ""Clicker hero's"" will understand it. Just replace the monsters with kemonomimis; let a few things looks more cute and release it.I don't know why so many Idle games appear right away, but in Sakura Clickers it's obvious that the studio just wanted to get fast money with an errfotless game, just because they have bikinis for 1€ each.Everyone who spend money in such a game is very near on the definiton of the word ""Victim""",0,anger

Oh man if I was back to being twelive this would be my dream game honestly. However as an idle game, it still scratches an itch. The woman are pleasing to the eye, the backing track is catchy, and it does have the addictive nature of the clicker games. Kill enemies, farm gold, level yourself and your allies for damage until you hit a wall, reset for upgrades, repeat. Sadly no achievements yet, but the game is still worth playing.

512,Sakura Clicker,2016,"To be brutally honest, as a human being, yes I found this game ""attractive."" But that's deep down in my genetic code. Listen her buddy ol pal, I enjoy women just as much as the next guy, but personally (emphasis on that word, by the way) I PERSONALLY do not like furries. But hey, I won't judge you for your preference.It's a good game where you're collecting oranges from dead women wearing thing clothes. So why do I not recommend it? Because it's just a copy paste of already successful games, except THIS PARTICULAR game has absurd in app purchases. But hey, people subscribe to Porn Hub, so who am I to judge?And yes, I reinstate, I am in no way against the idea of scantily clad women, but I just think there's kind of a limit to it.Also boobs.

513,Sakura Clicker,2017,"I think the best way to review a game like this is to break it down, in order to highlight everything properly:ART & DESIGN---------------Dude, 10/10 waifus. You got a huge array of waifus to punch, from the normal Cat, Fairy, and Dragon Girls, to the more out there Mud, Plant and Yuki-Onna Girls. And with each type of girl having a few different design assets, there's a surprising range of designs for the hoards of waifus you'll be clicking through. And if you're sad enough, you may even recognize a couple of assets, backgrounds, and girls from other Sakura games. And there's lots of diversity? You can also customize your player character, and if you shell out, you different little outfits for her, which, depending on the type of person you are, may interest you.SOUND-------I recommend playing this game 100% volume with no headphones to maximize the experience. The constant animu moaning that comes from this game is a wacky and fun thing to hear, and sometimes you get to hear Nya~!, which is, well, horrible, but the ironic charm is fantastic. This is all family friendly fun, you see.GAMEPLAY-----------It's your standard clicker game, where you click the waifus to add them to your harem (Yes, you punch monster girls to add them to your harem, it's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic) and get currency to purchase automatic clickers, and upgrades for them to make your clicks do more damage/make the automated attacks stronger/have little power ups. It's nothing out of the ordinary, but why fix what isn't broken? The clicker model has been proven, and this doesn't look to screw it up. The real differentiator comes from...DIFFICULTY CURVE--------------------Yo, this game gets pretty difficult in the end game. This clicker separates the men who wanna look at anime t*tties from the men who wanna play a decent clicker game, and also look at anime t*tties. You'll have to learn to utilize the reset mechanic, as well how to distribute points in order to maximize profit and progress as far as you can, or else you'll plateu in progression. You'll have to take what you learn from previous runs in order to get better.OVERALL----------This game is a MASTERPIECE. Clicker games are tried and true fun times, and this game is no exception. But pair this with the dynamic, diverse waifu punching, the FANTASTIC sound design, and actual strategy involved, it takes the game from an ironic 7/10 meme to a fun 10/10 time waster clicker game. Also, the fact that you can turn it off and still get cash helps level progression, and will save you from racking up too many hours actually in game, sparing you from the embarrasment of your family, friends, and colleagues. TL;DR------Dem gud anime t*tties",1,happiness

537,Sakura Clicker,2017,"As requested by a loyal fan, here is my review of Sakura Clicker.This game was created by the same folks behind the classic ""Sakura Swimclub"" and ""Sakura Dungeon"", but instead of the visual novel flare, this game instead is based upon the browser game ""cookie clicker"" where you click a cookie, however, in Sakura clicker, you are instead clicking on anime girls. as you progress, the girls you click on will gain more health, requiring you to hire new girls who do more damage to aid in adding the enemy girls to your harem (this also includes bosses). Gold is usually used to hire new girls, but beyond this, there is an underlying method of levelling girls, for example; to unlock abilities like added 5% gold per girl or +20% damage you may have to spend gold to get a hero to lv100 for an added 100% attack bonus. Additionally, it is possible to prestige to gain bonuses at the cost of your progress. A mechanic which I enjoyed was how you could close the game, but when you return you are rewarded with gold which you would have earned if you had stayed on, but returning to the game may be required for fighting bosses, requiring your presence to click and activate abilities (gained once leveling up the main hero). Another aspect of the game I found interesting was how every (enemy) girl has a slightly different look, whether it is the apparel, hair or eye colour. The music on the other hand does suffer from being repetitious. As far as I am aware, there is no story to date or lore, as well as no ending, or character development, however there is a girl by the side of the screen whom you can customise with a small variety of free hair, skin, eye and clothing options for free, but beyond these are microtransations for weapon, clothes and hair dlc (which Im personally not a fan of, but does not harm the core gameplay). All in all, it is a solid clicker game, another hit by the Sakura Team.Recommend that you play the game with the music and sound effects off, with the voice left on.Another gripe of mine would be the absence of a ~buff man in the game.",1,happiness

There is no end goal, just a bunch of... well, you have eyes, right? Hopefully ears too, there is some real quality variation of audio to be enjoyed.What few players care about: Strategy! Here are a few pointers to get you going.> Save your finger and mouse by investing in sidekicks immediately. After a good while you'll be able to unlock an ability that gives you gold per click, save your strength for that one since it's a crazy powerful booster.> Check an extra time that you locked the door so nobody walks in, your activity can be hard to explain.> Anything other than half naked females that pops up on the screen should be clicked immediately, preferrably 5000 times per second.> Are you using speakers? Keep the volume down or your neighbours will think you're molesting a dozen underaged Japanese girls.> First always try to unlock a new ""ally"", they are far more useful than investing in the same ones for long.> When you can't afford a new ally any time soon invest in the last one a few more times.> When you reach ridiculous numbers it's time to go back and upgrade allies but DO NOT attempt to get damage buffs that only affect themselves, this is a major trap with NO GAIN. Go for ""Gold Boost"" and ""All Damage Boost"".> Rule of thumb: every 100 levels of an ally increases their upgrade cost by 1,000 times, from level 200 to 400 is an increase of 1,000,000 times.> Once not even those cut it and you have even more ridiculous numbers, unlock your personal auto attack and unlock all bonuses from allies that give you a percentage of THEIR attack and all bonuses that increase odds of a critical hit.> When you really can't get any further you can boost your personal level to at least 450 and use ""Rebirth"" to get spirits used to buy permanent bonuses from various pets, you get more spirits the further you have progressed and the higher your personal level is. Boosting the Attack Speed is expensive but super mega worth it, second priority: boosting Gold, Ally Damage and All Damage. Investing in the boss timer will let you get further before next rebirth, giving you more spirits, for more upgrades, giving more spirits, for even more upgrades.> This game is incredibly pointless, once you embrace that with your heart and soul you'll possibly be able to quit wasting your life.

586,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access Review  Title WARMODE   Developer WARTEAM   Publisher WARTEAM  Release 25 August 2015  Graphics 3D   Genre FPS  Price Free-to-play  Rating 5/10 The game.WARMODE is a FPS about the confrontation of two sides, represented by the government military and the armed hirelings.Gameplay.An interesting game, still in early-alpha. Can be more than this or just stagnant here. Personally, I don't believe that can be more than this. There are some aspects that make the game be banal, like as weapon balance, some (or maybe the majority) weapons don't have no recoil, and the damage taken or induced is very weird. Btw, I played in a map much imitated of the Dust 2 of the Counter-Strike. I don't know the name but the map have very similar details. I don't like imitations.One more thing, if you have any first-person-shooter game experience, you'll literally be the best player on here and there is a great possibility of being called a hacker. One ranked as gold in CS GO can be a global here in just 20 minutes (lol). I got that feeling. Or in WARMODE just have low skill players.The game isn't bad but there are really betters on Steam. Some aspects like lag need to be fixed, servers are unstable. And please, don't compare CS GO to WARMODE, it only reveals ignorance. Counter-Strike has many years, already suffered so many changes and for sure is better, incomparable, WARMODE is an early-alpha game. The game is free, soft and with a simple interface, you need to consider these aspects too before give a negative review just because yes. I'll give a chance and I'll come back later.Positive points. (+)Free-to-play.Simple and fun interface.The devs read the reviews.Negative points. (-)Majority of the weapons don't have no recoil.The damage taken or induced is very weird.Could have more mods and maps.Need to fix some servers with lag. ",1,happiness

596,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewIt's really hard for me to get mad at a free to play game. Sure, this is far from being the best, but it is not the worst. It's not even bad, it's just a functional, pretty well done online shooter. If your looking for the same action as something like CS or TF2 you won't find it here, but what you will find is a pretty good free to play game. Also, this game gets two plus points: 1) All of the purchases don't unbalance the game, so you don't need to purchase anything. 2) It's actually being updated rather then cast to the side.Like I said, not the best game I've ever played, but certainly a good time waster and well worth it since it's free.I say give it a shot.",1,happiness

Great game and I know it's only in a beta but this game is awesome!,1,happiness
601,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis game has a lot of potential. Granted it ripped off games like Counter Strike and Call of Duty but what people fail to understand is that it's a FREE TO PLAY. You can't expect original games like TF2 from every single free to play. As a free to play this game so far is decent. No pay to win aspects like literally every other free to play FPS game out there. Easy to run, easy to learn. For broke peasants that can't afford to buy good FPS games, this game is alright.

604,WARMODE,2015,Early Access ReviewI like this game a lot it has similar mechanics to counter strike and is a very easy game to run so theres a good player base my only problem is the maps. I like the maps its just the fact that enemy teams can camp in your base and just kill each person that spawns in I think a way that they counter this is by adding a feature so when you spawn in you are invincible for a certain amount of time so that the enemy would just waste bullets instead of gaing many kills.,1,sadness

No other game lets me get spawn killed by a sniper better thanWARMODE *said screaming*No other game makes it so fun to camp behind a crate and wait for the enemy sniper to return just so i can shove my filthy nood knife in his poop hole... but wait! this isnt call of duty with just a normal melee system! This is...WARMODE *said screaming at the top of my lungs while thinking about cutting myself*No! Theres a 1/10 chance you score critical damage killing your enemie with one fell swoop! while the other attack is like hitting him with nerf sword lightly making him cry on the inside because he just realised how how ♥♥♥♥ed  america is if Trump or Clinton wins this election!

606,WARMODE,2015,Early Access Reviewok the game is ok its a 50 50 for me im not hating on the game the snipers i love ok just for i amzing but when you shot someone in the foot with no armour and they die that a little weird but still i like the snipers. 2 the hit detection is not the best but its ok for this game. 3 the price for some guns is really high and also you only get $300 if you get a normal kill and the same with a headshot so this game is a yes right now plus its free so you can get rid of the game if you do not like it so ye as long AS they do not make it pay then im happy.,1,happiness

Even worse, from my perspective, it looks like the dev's don't even bother to bar them from playing, they just give them a sub name ""Cheater"". Do yourself a favor and stay far from this game. Pros--Every map seems to be a retexture of old counterstrike maps. Pretty cool (even if it's bad)-Large and easily accesible gun library to mess with-Simple and easy controlsCons--Cheaters in every lobby-You get shot in the head a lot through the map-Angles control too much-Overprices crap weapons-Underpriced overpowered weapons-No one votes to kick the cheater-Your team will never win-Shader bugs in everymap make the fight one-sided-Like above con- Each map is sided towards the Warriors to win        -High ground and right turns with long tunnels to put a gunner downAs you can tell, I did not spend much time on this game due to the downsides provided above.",0,anger

615,WARMODE,2018,"Early Access ReviewThe game is not original, fun, and or exciting. The game seems like an obvious CS:GO ripoff, and doesn’t seem to stop copying CS:GOs motive. Too much loading times, terrible graphics, and too many hackers on it. So do I recommend it to people? The answer is... no and yes. Let me explain, if you are low on you’re steam account and can’t afford CS:GO. Then this would be the great alternative for you. But, if you already own CS:GO, it’s not really recommend for you to play it. Since it already has the same motives and traits to CS:GO. But anyways, my final review score for this game is a 5.5/10 and hopefully the developers will improve these problems and add something different to the game.

The only few downsides to this game are the lack of european and/or british servers and  the lack of controller support.  I really like the concept that each match you need to purchase weapons with currency you gain from killing enemies, the only downside is the fact that everyone starts the match with 2000 and that defeats the point as you have enough to purchase a weapon. There also needs to be a party aspec in this game so you can join a party with your friends and start a match.

626,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewIf you have a better PC than, you can probably run this better than me.Except, if you do have a better PC, you're probably better off playing other games.Doesn't look like P2W from what i can tell after playing for less than a hour(unlike RCF).",0,sadness
627,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewI recomend this game just because almost every computer can run it. My computer is very slow, but this game works perfectly fine. It's also really fun and addictive. If you don't have enough money to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive,  this is the best game for you. Go and play the game!",1,happiness
628,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewMy main rant about this game is that the servers are awfully Desynced. The lag the servers give is painful and can make your time playing this game at the up most annoying, However apart from the server issues this game is great so far.Worth quickly patching and having a go!Pros:- Simple GUI- Free 2 Play (No pay to win features atm)- Great gun collection- Simple and fun like counter strike- Easy 2 Run!Cons:- Poor server hosting-  Can get boring fairly quickly- Spawn killing is the kidz thing- May cause bursts of range due to DSync ",1,anger
629,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewHave you ever gazed upon something so perfect, so beautiful that simply to sit in its aura gave you impossible strength and love? Is this something you hope to feel in the near future? For me, Warmode was that and more. Before Warmode I was sad, depressed, and alone. After years of being laughed at in CSGO I was about to uninstall Steam. I left my friends my uninstall note, when I recieved a message of light and hope - ""get warmode♥♥♥♥♥"" Since then, I have become immersed in the amazing teamplay, unique guns, and well polished maps. The economic system scales incredibly well in Skirmish matches, and the guns are so well balanced that it appears as if years were taken to get them just go. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I would pay 60 dollars for this because this is an AAA release at heart. ",1,happiness
630,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewWARMODE is the poor man's Call of Duty, with elements of Counter-Strike. The idea might've been cool on paper, but just wait. Wait for the endless headshots to roll in, and make money at the rate of McDonald's frycook.",0,sadness
631,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewThe game is fun in an ironic way. It's really poorly designed, and the movement feels absolutely terrible, but I still had some fun playing this with a friend. The gunplay wasn't bad, but I didn't enjoy the movement. Also I hated that I couldn't change my crouch button to shift (what I've always used). The best part is that there is no pay to win issue at all, since you can buy guns with points in every match. I'd only recommend this game to someone who wants to have some (ironic) fun, preferably with friends. People are really bad in this game, so once you get a rifle/smg you can basically kill anyone.",1,sadness
632,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewGame has slippery, laggy mouse aiming. This is usually a vsync thing, but turning vsync off both ingame and in my GPU control panel didn't fix the issue. I hear coil whine so I'm pretty sure it's not vsync.Despite being pretty minimalistic and both looking and feeling like an alpha, the game actually has a pretty nice feel as a brainless run and gun shooter but loose mouse aiming makes it unplayable.",0,sadness
633,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewI want to recommend this game because it in its self is a fun game. However there are many draw backs.Pros:- It runs (automatically better than most free to play games)- Has a lot of potential- A Counter Strike sort of gameplay for those who enjoy that (buy gear at the beginning with credits, get kills for credits, etc.)- VERY fast paced gameplay and heavily relies on reaction to events.- [This is an opinion for me] Small maps work very well for this game, they're no larger than a Counter Strike or Call of Duty map. Cons: - No unlocking or loot system, only items in game are cosmetics bought with real money. (Nothing expensive, most items are $1 or $2, but the point still stands) - Game disconnects from matches 75% of the time, forcing the user to loose all credit towards their next rank they gained that match- VERY unbalanced. Certain guns rule the game and others are useless. The SPAS-12 shotgun is one of if not the best gun and you can buy it with the credits you get when you start the match. Also many guns are over powered, under powered, bad aim, too good aim, etc. The shotguns can only hit up to about 5 yards and if its not point blank then its ~1 damage. The pistols have no recoil giving those who are good with them or hackers (more on that later) a very easy chance. The assault rifles are crap, bad recoil, large cone of fire, damage regarding range is bad (AK's give more damage at 10 yards than an M4 Carbine)- Clipping errors. The models and entities clipped into eachother often.- Headshots. This one sounds like a pro but its not, the head hitboxes on a player are massive, Making nearly every shot you take a headshot and an instant kill. - Lag. I know you'd think a game thaat doesnt require much of a computer and only a 200mb download wouldn't lag much but it seems you're wrong. Certain guns when fired cause small lags spikes as if the audio, animation, and effects have never been precached or loaded at all. Then shooting them again causes the same lag like its loading it brand new again causing the fast paced gameplay to be choppy and ultimately make you loose. - Hackers. Good lord the hackers. It's mostly small children aimbotting with the starting pistol. Normally that would be fine but considering 2 of the other cons  mentioned. that pistol is a 1 hit kill when its a headshot (even if you have the max armor upgrasde which doubles your health) and  the head hitboxes are enormous. That being said they instantly kil you. THIS GAME NEEDS AN ANTI-CHEAT BADLYAll in all I'd probably say a 5/10 with tons of room for improvement and a lot of potentional. If the devs fix those cons and bugs, and implement a working anti-cheat of some sort (this is none of right now) then I can see my review changing to positive and my time spent playing this game going up drastically, maybe even buying some items from the ingame store.",0,happiness
634,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewI own Source and GO and I still think this game is fun, sure it might be a knock off but its sure fun to play for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. I mean the guns are stupid OP and the movement is pretty jank, the point of games is to have fun and I think people would have more fun playing a glitchy game and laughing at the random stuff that happens in it rather than a less glitchy game with better gameplay. Overall its just too much fun to run around and knife people in the face or AWP them from unfair spots.",1,happiness
635,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewHoly balls. Bear in mind, this is from someone who doesn't normally like fps's, and even though I suck, this is one of the most fun games I've played. And♥♥♥♥♥♥s sake it's free. What more do you need?",1,anger
636,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewEnglish:This game is actually pretty fun! It does not have decent graphics and weapon recoils are pretty much non-existence, but jumping into the game and messing up with enemies did bring me a lot of joy. This is a F2P game so do not expect it has AAA title's quality. Ingame store is pretty much useless since you can have access to all weapons in game and all you need to do is to accumulate money by killing enemies. There are only masks and badges in store and they won't affect statistics whatsoever. Check this out if you want to kill some time or find some free games to dig in.ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡ï¼š",1,happiness
637,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewAlright, another f2p first person shooter. After an hour of playing i can say, this game is pretty fun, the only problems being the spawns on certian maps (Sewers having the best spawns honestly) and the guns are varied, literally the best thing you hope for is a clear sight apreture. The only paying part of the game is $0.99 masks for either side, that being the ONLY thing that requires real money. The servers could be a bit better, but are for the most part stable. I hope to get more maps, i think attachments and extra weapons would be a nice touch. Other than that, a solid free game that i no doubt will enjoy.I recommend this as a nice casual shooter for you and your friends, and Don't worry about servers, there's like 300+ servers.",1,happiness
638,WARMODE,2017,Early Access ReviewThis game is cs:go without all the fancy crap(Well some crap) i could play this all day its a good game that gets underated and gets hate becuase of hackers...if theres hackers ask for some anti cheat or something before you post hate like its good and i think this is better than cs:go,1,happiness
639,WARMODE,2017,Early Access ReviewStill in Early Access so don't expect too much..Pros- Free to Play-Not paid to win-------------------Cons- Laggy servers- Expect hackers- Unbalanced (knives are 1hit kills) ,1,sadness

644,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewEnglish:This game is actually pretty fun! It does not have decent graphics and weapon recoils are pretty much non-existence, but jumping into the game and messing up with enemies did bring me a lot of joy. This is a F2P game so do not expect it has AAA title's quality. Ingame store is pretty much useless since you can have access to all weapons in game and all you need to do is to accumulate money by killing enemies. There are only masks and badges in store and they won't affect statistics whatsoever. Check this out if you want to kill some time or find some free games to dig in.简体中文：毛子做的游戏，挺有意思的。虽然画面不咋地而且武器后座力基本不存在，但是进游戏去虐虐歪果仁还是挺好玩的。毕竟是免费游戏所以不要期待它会有3A大作的质量。游戏内商城基本就和没有一样，所有武器在初始时都已经给了，你要做的就是在游戏里杀人赚钱买好枪。商城里只有名片徽章和面具，然而这些并不会影响人物和武器属性。如果想打发时间或者找点免费游戏玩的话，这款游戏还是挺好的。",1,happiness
645,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewIt's all about shooting, and a bit of teamwork so it would be a good game, if the hackers got banned or something like that.BTW not bad, 696969 fps on comodor69, free, 400mb etc... ",1,happiness
646,WARMODE,2018,"Early Access ReviewUntil they implement something like VAC don't even bother with this game.Every ♥♥♥♥ing time I go the the server there's at least one cheater in my or enemy team and worst part that you can't even kick them. Apperently there's a flag system that you could vote on, but srsly how many hours or days he will be hacking until those flags will be acounted? And even  if that♥♥♥♥♥♥will get banned he will be back in 5 seconds with a new steam account, since it's free to play.Devs at least add a ♥♥♥♥ing kick option, you must clearly autistic.....Another option is to make a game non free to play, like at least 5$ or something.Other than problem with hackers, game has some potential.",0,anger
647,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewThis is actually a pretty good game, although there are alot of hackers which make it less fun. But recently I've noticed alot of people turning against hackers and leaving them in empty lobbies. But its very fun, pretty easy, the poor man's csgo. Would definitely recommend, just beware of hackers.",1,happiness
648,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewWarmode is the most hella dank F2P shooter available at the market today.The game includes such awesome weaponry.The physics engine is like nothing you have ever seen!Counter Strike, Call of Duty, Battlefield, forget that nonsense, get yourself Warmode and join the fun today!!!!!!",1,happiness
649,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewIt's time for a pros and cons =)Pros#1:Most people are friendly, hardly ever get the kid that rages over getting killed too much#2:It's not pay to win like most ""Free"" games#3:Every game starts off fresh, So the person who has played for months doesnt get an advantage at the start#4:Control feels smooth.Cons#1:Hackers... Some hackers are somewhat decent though... atleast let you get some kills in, they just want a rage finish usually, I have not seen a hacker that has stayed more then 15 minutes... ignore them, They leave... They have fun listening to you rage... Best bet is just to ignore them, they usually go to another server looking for the kid that rages.#2:No Vote ban, I know people abuse this... but vote ban is a good thing to have...#3:Can't host your own server.========================Overall...If you are mature and don't mind a troll hacker every now and then... It's free.... It's not that big of a game... Try it....",1,happiness

653,WARMODE,2017,Early Access ReviewI don't know if this game is still like this but my experience was purely awful it is an average fps nothing new with not to-new graphics but I hate this game I give it 5/10,0,sadness
654,WARMODE,2018,Early Access ReviewThis is one of my favorite FPS of steam this one has good grafics guns and fine maps.This game dont have hackers well all game has hackers this one is realistic so you die with a headshot.But the gamer ists very good,1,happiness
655,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewIt to be honest is not that bad, its the buggy gameplay that is bad. i could only run the gam in windowed mode or it would run at a solid 5 fps, and i dont have a terrible computer, naw im joking ♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥dawg",0,sadness
656,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewLike CS:GO, but for free, and without the nonsense of recoil patterns. Surprisingly good graphics as well. Could be more active, especially outside of deathmatch.",1,happiness

658,WARMODE,2015,Early Access ReviewGood game for free but...Could be played instead of CS:GO as a free filler for it but there are things that need to be improved on and also added to this game for overall better experience. Also Submachine gun is mispespelled as submachune gun in game. But overall IMO it is a fun game.,1,sadness
659,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewOkay, so obviously this game is receiving alot of unecessary hate. Look people, it's an EARLY ACCESS GAME, so bugs like the frequent headshots despite shooting someone in the balls will most likely be fixed.This a great game. It's gonna run on pretty much anything, the graphics are nice, and the best part is... IST KOSTENLOS!!!!!!! ",1,sadness
660,WARMODE,2016,Early Access Reviewi actullay really enjoy this game. its really fun to play on my laptop and even on my main computer. the game isn't perfect however i belive its a really fun arcadey kinda game :).,1,happiness
661,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewWarnode is a free to play game that is a FPS sort of like a CounterStrike clone.  It is PVP only.  It worked, played ok, sounded ok, looked ok, was mostly understandable.  Might be from Russian developer.  Has server system so no matchmaking, they are 16 vs 16. CONS: -Has hackers playing, and have no anti-hacking scanner.   - Didn't see a ping meter on server and playing.  -There is some russian words still this english localization.  -No tutorial, help or hints.Try it, but there are better games out there for free.

662,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewA really bad game, Ok not so much but mostly. First off this game is decent for a free game. Heres why I dont recommend it. The community is filled with hackers you will probably not see a lobby without a hacker. This game is trash honestly due to its rude and awful community (Yes Im aware there are nice people in all communities but this game is filled with stupid people)",0,sadness
663,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewDem Hackers are everywhere especially Blackmode ProsIts a good game to get into FPS shooters if you are a poor gamer like meAlso 4 Game modes Zombie, Deathmatch, Detonation and some other thing i cant rememberCons Nowadays there are too many hackers",0,happiness
664,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewAwesome game. Sad thing is when you join you have to use in game points or whatever to buy the guns. the more kills you get the better guns you can get, altjhough you must restart buying them again every round it makes a solid statement and adds a little more uniqueness. most people are hating and giving this game mixed reviews because of their lack of knowledge with FPS games. just about any player that has any FPS experience whatsoever can jump in and kick some serious @ss and all the players getting r@ped come and make that huge commitment to make that negative review as they cry into their keyboard. rarely few have issues with this game. ive heard of _authorization issue but only like 1/20 will actually have this issue.Pros : 1 - Good, Smooth FPS Gameplay2 - Free To Play (For people who dont wanna drop their bank on CSGO when other games can compete at it!)3 - Nice Menu4 - Not bad loading times5 - EXTREMELY easy to kick @ss atCons : 1 - Spawn Shield lasts way too long2 - Pretty decent amount of weapons but their could be more3 - Small Maps4 - Whining Peple in dozens complaining about hackers everywhere (which are just good players, not hackers)Also i have been called a hacker so many times its drilled into my head by now. only thing is that all i play is FPS games 24/7. games like Arma3, Battlefield 4/3, Destiny, etc. So basically i just got alot of experience and i can run in and kick @ss and everyone gets butthurt when i get that 14/1 K/D and then dedicated a review to people just like me. dont listen to people like that. And if your an easy whiner i dont think this is the game for you. but anyone else should jump in and if your good at it just wait for the hate spam of noobs in the chat XD",1,sadness
665,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis game? Where do i even start. Maybe the part where i cant get past the authorization loading screen, so i cant actually play the game. In total i have waited for 65mins for this game to load and it hasnt, even if i uninstall the game and reinstall it, it still wont load. Maybe if they fix the problem then the game might be alright but for know this game isnt very good!!!!",0,sadness
666,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewDustforce truly is a work of art. I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level. Another thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.Overall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:10/10BUY THIS GAME.",1,happiness
667,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewDon't lose your time with this game. Actually a good free-to-play game... BUT... its full of cheater.Free-to-play game + cheats = actually sh*t.Please fix, maybe one day. One day. This can be a good Free-to-Play game.",0,anger
668,WARMODE,2016,Early Access ReviewThe game basically sucks it has no real animations the game i would rate it a 2/10 there is no such thing in this game about spray patterns and yhere are too many hackers and no anti-chat system,0,anger
669,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewI want to reccommend this game. I really do.Sad thing is the servers are all located in Russia. So my lag is really really bad.(If they add servers, like Asian ones. I'd probably enjoy this game more.)The graphics are fine, and i really see the POTENTIAL for this to be a great f2p.(unless they make it a game you should buy, which i am not sure about.)If, and maybe if. The Developers fix some things (Like the ugh, text buy menu), get a better anticheat (maybe?)I want to be able to play this again in the future. Perhaps when they fully release it?Or rather when they fix most of it/ add more servers / put a ping checker.I want to believe. I really do.",0,sadness
670,WARMODE,2017,Early Access ReviewThis is like a terrible version of call of duty. now i've never played call of duty myself but let me tell u something i have a friend from my church that playys the game regularly and he is pretty good at it and i had him play this with me he said it was the worst piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥he has ever seen i agree with him not only is this game not worth the web page its printed on the prices r way too high the gun r very inaccurate the hitboxes r♥♥♥♥♥♥and the FPS is horrenous never in my life have ive seen such a bad excuse for not only a game but something that in its review said it was suppost to be better than call of duty and battlefield well let me tell u something whoever it is that created this game get a real life u absoultly suck at war game and would better off going back to your worthless mom and breastfed a little longer you ♥♥♥♥ing worthless piece of♥♥♥♥♥,0,happiness
671,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis game is very interesting to me it's not TOO bad but it is still enjoyable, they try to copy the concept of cs:go but they really ruined it though there lots of hackers, empty servers, and lot's of glitches, it is still fun to play for example: If you find an empty server 1v1 your friend! There are also many glitches that I mentioned earlier and also those you can mess around with and try to find new glitches! and for the hacking part just do a 1v1 with hacks, like hacker versus hacker. But in conclusion I really do enjoy playing this game with friends just how it is!",1,sadness

Quite frankly i would rate this game 9/10 but really it kinda more deserves a 0.33/7 due to it beeing sold in all countries except for europe. Also Hobo Haram's inclution in this game is too fragile and offensive so tone it down little boy, don't need any tumblebundles down the street yelling the mayor's name over and over as the night turned sky. But in all honesty... REEALLY♥♥♥♥♥♥game that i recommend only to you guuuuuuuuuuurl ;)))  ",1,happiness
673,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewSimple Indie shooter. Really rough around the edges but its playable. Warmode itself is really generic, but if thats not a problem for you and you are interested in playing a rough around the edges shooter like this, more power to you.  In the end though the game plays like COD with a CS buy weapons system. Throw in really basic textures and models and you have yourself a WARMODE.",1,happiness
674,WARMODE,2018,"Early Access ReviewLOL this game is funny stilli played this game for very few hrs, i did enjoy it and its simplicity however i just returned to the game a few months later out of pure bordom and to my suprise a little text box saying ""YOUR BANNED!

676,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewThere are no hackers, you guys just lag!it is actually a helarious game!!It's basically CounterStrike but with smaller maps and faster gameplay!It is really funny, for example:If you touch the crates you could actually die!by the time you have 8000 to buy the Heavy mechine guns the game is about to finish!if you want to run eventhough you have a heavy weapon just scroll to the handgun XD",1,anger
677,WARMODE,2018,Early Access ReviewThis game is worse than actual garbage. A majority of the weapons do not do anything at all and you're better off running with a knife around the map. The hit boxes are so ♥♥♥♥ed that you walked over people. There is 1 weapon worth buying in this whole game: The ASVAL. If you buy anything else you're ♥♥♥♥ing disabled. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless you're 12 and you're not brave enough to steal your mom's credit card to buy Counter-Strike. The game is just a plain rip-off of it. One of the maps is literally a section of a dust_2 and the devs were so ♥♥♥♥ing lazy they just said ♥♥♥♥ it and closed B halls off and made a TDM map.,0,anger
678,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewI threw this on because it was free to play. I was expecting it to be kind of a joke of a game. Luckily, I was super surprised.This game is fun as hell. I had a blast playing this. The game was lacking music though which made it too silent.The controls for this game so far I would have to say are pretty damn good. Graphics could use polish, but it's early access so it's doable.It's not pay to win, the paid content seems to be cosmetic only from what I could see. The game mode I played was called Skirmish and it was fun stuff.I recorded when I was first trying out the game so if you like first impression videos check this out.https://youtu.be/DCT2-BiBpdkI would recommend this because I had lots of fun and it is free to play. Hopefully we'll see some nice updates in the fear future.",1,happiness
679,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewIn the short time I played this game, Me and my friends noticed Factory is a rip off of Dust 2 from Counter Strike Global Offensive. Also the engine has a critical issue of lag. When you press a button on mouse or keyboard there is an extreme delay between the button being pressed and what actually happens on screen. Also, the maps are spawn trap city. PLEASE update the spawn system in this game. We were able to spawn trap VERY easily. These are game breaking issues that need to be addressed.. AND for the fact that they copied Dust 2 is just the last straw.",0,sadness
680,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access Reviewthis game is trying to copy counter strike series. it copyed some of the maps like dust2 and most of the weapons is similar to cs but the gameplay and the game mechanic is terrible and its not worth playing. i know its still in beta but just by playing a few matches heres what i found, you can just buy a ump and top score in your team because i dont know y but every one playing this game is acting like bots until someone accually said something then i know their not bots and all ou can buy from the shops is masks(which change how you charecters face looks and badges and they all cost 99cents each!so this game is not worth the time, theres alot of other free to play games that is wayyy more better than this",0,happiness

682,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewOverall, I enjoy this game because it has some interesting ideas, however, snipers are kinda too good and the mouse acceleraion kinda kills it but otherwise, it's a great game.",1,happiness
683,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewThe game looks pretty good in the store, but the maps are boring, and the guns barely do any damage, this means that the AWP (The one shot sniper) and the Deagle (The most powerful gun) are extremely op, meaning that buying anything else is just piontless, overall a pretty bad game.Don't install, after 5 minutes of Play time, ur gonna wan't to uninstall..",0,sadness

685,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewIt's just a knock off CS:GO, which is not right, what this really does it just influences people to believe that this game is supposedly better than CS:GO, but it fails because it has spawn camp which CS:GO doesnt have (only in warmup). Overall, this game is just a waste of time because you can somehow kill yourself with your own knife which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that you cannot join a server without being spawn camped or killed.",0,sadness
686,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewThe game has potential(Like Advanced Warfare did). The armor should do something, nerf the ARs, buff shotgun damage, and make it so headshots aren't one shot with any gun.",1,sadness
687,WARMODE,2016,Early Access ReviewThis game is like counter strike with guns!I rektum end this game to errbody who is gooder in the clubber getting terttented.Many bung choo chee  9.11/9.11Minecraft has never been done like this before!,1,happiness
688,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewThe movement is buggy, crouching is buggy, the mouse movement is laggy and feels non-responsive. The servers suck, the UI is trash and the community is whining about hackers all the time (most of it is just lag from my experience). The guns are ridiculously op, the spawns are broken, there are angles that provide immense advantage (others players can't shoot you), there is no need for iron sights. However, I had loads of fun playing this game. Headshotting from 2km away with a pistol is satisfying. The game is really small in size and for the time being it is truly f2p. I like the point system to buy guns but I think you should be able to gain points over time. Also more options should be implemented (FOV slider for example). The game needs a lot of work but it has the potential to have something going for it as far as I am concerned. Overall, I thought the game was fun and I could oversee the flaws. I recommend it if you want to pass some free time. In the future I might revisit it and maybe change my recommendation but for the time being this game is fairly fun.",1,sadness
689,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewTried to give this game a shot, however the only thing I was able to access was the menu upon opening the game. There are only about 8 active RU servers (span out across a large number of ""channels"") and they're all 16/16 players. Trying to get into one of these in the extremely rare occurrence that there's a slot open gives a blank splash screen which goes back to the menu. Trying to join any empty server (and there are tons of them) does the same thing; black screen, then dropping back to the main menu.0/10",0,sadness
690,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access Reviewi really like this game it has alot of potential and it did feel like a bit of a stalker multiplayer clone but that was the reason i liked it, please add more stalker weapons and maps also please add more options",1,happiness
691,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewFor one hour of gameplay, I have to say this FPS has a lot of potential, with many pros and cons. The server that I have played on seems a bit laggy and that's acceptable for an early access game in my opinion, with the simple HUD and basic concepts of this game, I got right into the game for an hour straight. Although the servers were not completely full so about 4 people on each team. At first I thought you had to buy a weapon each time you died e.g. Counter Strike, that's the only thing that took me a few moments to realize that when you buy guns, armor, and other items that you spawn with them for the rest of the game. I also feel that people need to start playing or at least trying this game for a week considering it's in early access and does not need 30GB of space to play which is great in my opinion. Overall rating is a solid 7.5/10.",1,sadness
692,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewHonestly, there is a bug where it gets stuck on the authorization screen, but sometimes you just need to refresh the game. It is a very fun game after that. There may be a lot of hackers, but sometimes there is not. I fully recomend this game if you do not have enough money for CSGO or Call of Duty",1,happiness
693,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewHi i have recently got this game and it is really promising heres a list of pros and cons -Pros -Good easy all around gameplay -weapon buy system, good inspiration from csgo -maps are really good BUT need better spawn protection and prypat spawn for mercs needs light, hangers is the best map -good for low-level pcs -Just good all around in a simple sentence -Cons -CHEATERS ALMOST EVERYWHERE THE GAME EVEN SAYS THEY ARE CHEATERS BUT DOESNT BAN THEM BUT BANS NON-CHEATERS -Hitboxes need polishing -servers need admins for kicking cheaters-personally connection is sometimes bad but always recovers. good job at servers-PKP NEEDS NERFING -Needs responsive hits and kills on people -Prpyat merc spawn needs fixing -Suggestions -No paying for Masks and banners -NEEDS in game curency BUT NO SPINS/BATTLEPACKS JUST round earnt currency -Add in weapon skins that you can buy with IN-GAME currency please -Stop with new stuff for a while and teak and polish the game for a year or so please. then this will be a great game for everyone to enjoy this simple shooter experience -Conclusion -PLAY THIS GODDAMN GREAT GAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!

695,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access Review     Well the idea of this game is great. It has unique features and has good graphics for a free game. In fact, I would say that this is a pretty awesome FPS game and I usually hate FPS games. But notice how I said WOULD... Thats because although the game is there, the most important things for an FPS game to have aren't! What I mean by that is half of the time your bullets damage an enemy and half of the time they don't. Also the assist system is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that I cant even comprehend it. But my favorite flaw, other than all of the maps being as big as my bathroom, is the random suicide deaths. I'll just be standing there and out of nowhere I die and it says I was killed by me. Now I cant for the life of me figure out what is causing this, it's just completely random.     I really hope that this game is in its beta because it is so close to being a great game. All the game makers need to do is add a North American Channel for servers and fix the major bugs involoved with causing damage, the assist system, add larger maps, and fix the kill system. I would recommend that you try the game for 30 minutes tops and then delete it. I feel that you will agree with me that this game has potential, it just needs some major fixes.",1,happiness
696,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewPeople who downvoted this game, ITS IN EARLY ACESS. That means things will change, they will implement things better, add new things, make it fun, ya know? I put only 3.6 hours into it and i already find it quite fun. Let me break down the game a bit and what I think are the pros and cons of this game so far:PROS:Great graphics for an early acess! They are amazing for a free to play shooter!Gameplay is fast-paced, very fun.The gun selection is quite nice, although some, like the AK47 and the AUG need a bit of balancing.CONS:The teams can get out of balance incredibly quick. it could be a 3v1 and I have seen games as far away as 5v2. Although I have seen some good players, they aren't that good.The semiauto shotgun is a bit op, as it does a lot of damage from a farther range you are used to.There is only one game mode at the moment. Even though it is still an amazing game for early access, one game mode puts me off a bit.Most of the weapons you can get a tapshoot kill with, which is dissapointing, because i would rather have only a few weapons that that can one hit kill, which would mean balancing out all of the assault rifles, and balancing up the smgs.All in all, a great game for early acess. Recommend it for experienced gamers. Great job WARTEAM!",1,happiness

698,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewIf you wanted to play free to play games, this one, don`t even bother playing it.This is a game where ""developer"" try to imitate Counter-Strike games but failed horriblely,And they dare to add the most useless, and unworthly microtransaction. Only they selling is just ""A"" skin.Skin that I mention is ""Skin"" of a gun, ""Emblems"", and of course ""Masks.""Thats it? Thats what you can do on the Microtransaction? Super useless piece of item and dare to sell at $0.99 each?So its complete useless Microtransaction, so how about the game?Its a 2 Gamemode only, Skrimish, and Elimination.Skirmish is similar to Team-Deathmatch, only this here, is a bad Skirmish game, Elimination is idk vs idk Counter-Strike rip-off. Balancing Team is complete stupid and frequent unbalanced team.Guns are just a Ho-hum guns, everything looks pale and boring to shoot, it feels weird when shooting something, and its not like other shooting games, where you found it ""fun"" to shoot at, here is zero fun. I didn`t enjoy at all, P90 why u too nub to shoot, Shotgun, why u too op, M249, why u 1 shot kill player and why super expensive to buy? Why, all weapon damage feels imbalanced and i didn't find any favorable gun that i like to use. Except shotgun, which is super effective.Server is only in 3 ""Channels"", where player need to join the channels room to play, but I found out this is very familiar.Is this a developer from 3D Blockade? Server was laggy, have super buggy state of art, super buggy of poor net code. For me, at least on Asia. I probably realized this was hosted on Russia. Right. I also died by myself, is that poor net code for me?Hackers, yeah. It has, but is it hackable without ban? Yeah. No one give a damn about banning a person. You can`t even kick player, is it majority of the player who vote will win? No, no one will win if someone ""vote"" no on purpose of gaining winning. Ban VAC? Who gives a shyt, no one get ban.Graphics are just meh, but sound design is awful, its like they fked up the whole sound library. There`s no voice actor or any voice from this game, there`s no Hit detection where you getting hitted by enemy. Its like incomplete release.And lastly, did I mention the game have ""Leveling"" system... talk about the ""useless"" leveling system ever created? You gain EXP by winning a game. So what it does for EXP? Nothing. Yeah nothing. Zero functionality in EXP. Except unlocking skin which requires you 0.99$ to buy????Seriously this game, even though ppl recommended this game, I despite everything this game yet to offer. Even though its Free, you may thinking, Free is the reason why you set ""Yes"" as a good game, unfortunately, like me itself, I feel like I need to play other game instead. I say a lot of free games like Blackshot is even better than this, even a game like Crazy Shooter Online is 20 times better, this game isn`t. Its just a garbage game.There`s nothing to offer, there`s nothing that can redeem enjoyable, there`s zero factors of entertaining yourself, there`s zero communities, there`s zero calories and fats that can be burn on this game, mean factor of losing fats is no longer exist in this game and you can't even excersice on this game. I just can`t, I just wanted more biceps for playing a Shooter games. In the end, games sucks. Go play other free game instead.(2/10)",0,sadness
699,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewI actually like this game, its not bad to its core. It just has ALOT of issues that need to bet dealt with. The servers need ping counters.

713,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewWarmode is an arcadey shooter similar to the Call of Duty or Battlefield franchise. It features a selection of game modes, maps and weapons. The player base is decent, if mostly Russian, due to the developers being Russian, and the game as a whole is built in Unity.  What Warmode brings to the table is pure simplicity. It has low requirements, under 1GB for space and it's 99% free. Only thing you can buy here are some masks, but they're only cosmetic and are a way of supporting the developers.   The game, however is full of bugs, broken mechanics and hackers. It isn't a very good substitute for any of the paid competitive shooters.

(with ingame money)One of the maps makes me miss cod4 (best cod imo)Generic but realistic looking gunsNot exactly next-gen graphics, as a matter of fact they kind of look scetchy but i feel this is part of the games charm, so it belongs in prosCons:I dont think theres an anti-cheat, so game is flooded with cheaters, though avoiding them is easy, its still annoyingHopefully more game mods, more servers for every region (except russia) and pre-game lobbing would be a nice edition.Small maps, i thought of putting this is pros because i absolutely love it since its very instant action but most people dislike it, if you dont like small maps i dont think this game is for youIts in Alpha, i hate early stage game. even though this game does fine for my taste i cant help but feel like the developers dont know where they want this game to go, its kind of just out there for now",1,sadness
732,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewLearn how to develop a ♥♥♥♥ing game.

Level system allows player to open achievements, weapons, stickers and more.______________MY OPINION_____________Okay. In my opinion, The game is some kind of CS:GO ripoff.

735,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewWARMODEThis is a quiet good first game from WARTEAM. This game has its ups and downs, but in this review, I would not judge this game too harshly. This is an online FPS game. A great range/variety of weapons to buy to use against the dangerous enemies. What I find is that the damage the weapons do is not that much, unless you get headshots. But like I said this is WARTEAM's first game and they should keep on trying. Speaking of the developers, they should really keep an eye on this game and do updates/patches.There are a couple of good maps. But the map that really catches my eye, is the one that they ripped off of Counter-Strike. Developers, if you are reading this, I wouldnt recommend to rip off maps from other games because you may get copyright strikes and negetive reviews because you ripped the map off. But I see that you made a couple mps of your own and I quiet like them.The last time I got onto this game, the multiplayer was dead. In patches/updates try putting something into the game that make the game even more entertaining, like more game modes, for example.Overall, I think these developers should keep on trying to update/create games, keep up the good work!7.2/10 ",1,sadness

Through many dangers, toils and snares,    I have already come;    ’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,    And grace will lead me home.    The Lord has promised good to me,    His Word my hope secures;    He will my Shield and Portion be,    As long as life endures.    Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,    And mortal life shall cease,    I shall possess, within the veil,    A life of joy and peace.    The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,    The sun forbear to shine;    But God, who called me here below,    Will be forever mine.

738,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewFor the size, and for being free i recommend it, but its not that good.For my opinion they should make this a browser game or update the graphics. Trying to copy CS but it feels diferent, swhitching guns its a little slow, headshot doesnt feel that great, and maybe but just maybe they should remove the right click thing :PMaybe I'll play it again.4/10",1,sadness
739,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewWow, warmode team, nice work. but must add more maps and a Normal gamemode example TDM or FFA and i would like to see in the game is Gungames or some Gamemodes with the Bomb in CS:GO. and also more skins for each weapon, and a Website to see Informations about Warmode.Thanks for this Game Warmode Team.But i know it is an Early Acces game, but now it's really nice and super Awesome :D",1,happiness
740,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewWelcome to my review!To shorten this review for you people skimming through review section, wondering if you should install or not:Just. Don't. Install.Here's why:Pros: fast-paced, simple shooter.Cons:Terrible, I mean TERRIBLE Hit detection.Laggy serversBad spelling/grammar in the menus (ex. ""YOU KILLED BY PLAYERNAME"", ""SUBMACHUNGUNS"")Absolutely no gun balance, the most expensive gun is always the best, therefor there are no guns to suit different playstyles, because they all have near the same firerate, mag capacity, etc.Iron sights are extremely innacurate, bullet hits a good 2 feet above where you aim.Horrible community, mainly pre-pubescents saying its more realistic than CS:GOSounds often bug out, R.I.P Headphone users.Very limited options menuFog... way 2 much fog.So basically bad game.Also, when a gun is ""nerfed"" (ex. M60) it becomes worse than any other gun of that catagory. ",0,anger
741,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewI love the feel of this game...its very Counter Strike/Call of Duty. I just wish there were some Australian servers, as the lag for us is just horrible right now.",1,happiness
742,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewNo. It's trash. Play Alliance of Valiant Arms, it's free. If your computer can't run it then play Crossfire it's free too. Anything but this. But stay away from Combat Arms.",0,anger
743,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewWARMODE is really fun, its a F2P game which is small in size, the maps are small and there are so many server issues such as lagging, crashing and etc, but i do recommend it, its a very simple FPS shooter.",1,happiness
744,WARMODE,2016,Early Access ReviewIts very fun but needs to be a little bit changed like with the way you buy guns and you should be able to cary a bought primary of choice out to battle then buy guns ,1,happiness
745,WARMODE,2015,Early Access ReviewWarface is a game where you walk around shooting people.Except of guns you get bb guns that is as accurate as Fox news.why is this on steam its like pre pre pre aplha,0,happiness

747,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis game is based like csgo, thats because of the weapons and because of the settings I even named it csgo version 2) but still its free and very descent so play this game instead of csgo because its free! Bye it was ИEON#wallha.KZ IF U WANT TO PLAY CSGO OR WARMODE TEXT ME!",1,happiness
748,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewReally fun to play. Really simple concept. Love the mechanics, does need to be smoothed out a bit with fps drops now and again. Also game crashes on map switching and usually have to redownload the game after closing down. Need some competitive element to this game to bring in some more hardcore players. Keep working on it guys doing well.",1,happiness
749,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis game has a lot of players. That can be a good thing or a bad thing. You will either kill everybody, or everybody will kill you. There is also a BIG problem with spawncamping. Most players camp out at 1 of the 2 spawnpoints in a map and wait to kill you as you spawn. There is a spawn protection, but it does not do much. Other than that, it is easy to learn and you will become good at this game very fast. 7/10 overall",1,sadness
750,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis game is a free to play knock off CSGO. The guns are the same as CSGO and you even purchase them the same way too. If you know how to play CS then you know how to play this. There is even a knock-off dust2 and aim map. It's almost hilarious how this game even exists. Seriously, do yourself a favor and just play CS. It was kinda funny to play a really bad csgo, actually it was hilarious, but I don't think you'll ever play this game more than twice. With that being said, I cannot recommend this unless you need something to play until you can earn $15 to buy CSGO.",0,happiness
751,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis game is basically a CS:GO rip-off. But because CS:GO isn't a good game, its rip-off cannot be good. However I recommend you play this if your computer is equipped with a pentium 4 and you have some friends with pentium 4 machines around. Beware of hackers though ;D ",1,happiness
