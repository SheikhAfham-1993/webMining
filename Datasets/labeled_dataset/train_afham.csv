0,1,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"I'm scared and hearing creepy voices.  So I'll pause for a moment and write a review while I wait for my heart beat to return to atleast somewhat calmer times.  This game is adorable and creepy like my happy tree friends but with the graphics sceme of my childhood (but more bubble and 'clean').  Hello 1990's.What charactes there are (that isnot trying to kill me) were likable and a bit odd.  I did do a few noob things though, such as:Oh look a class room full of ghosts from dead children, lets shine my flashlight on them and stand there staring at them..Or, hmm creepy music, I'll turn around and see if I can see what's chasing me.Never before in a game have I been this afraid of finding a locked door.",1,fear

You haven't downloaded it yet.",1,happiness
2,3,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"A littly iffy on the controls, but once you know how to play, very easy to master. I've made it to floor 1000 before, but due to certain circumstances was unable to finish. Was not game related, don't worry, not a bug/glitch or antyhing.I highly recommend this for casual play, maybe with a friend or two watching. Hilarity ensues, especially once you hit floor 150. Have fun my fellow fleshlings!",1,happiness
3,4,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Great game, fun and colorful and all that.A side note, though: When are we getting windowed mode? My computer hates fullscreen so.... yeah. The computer doesn't like to run this. Shame, because this is really enjoyable. But until then, I guess I'll settle for more Skyrim. Cheers!",1,happiness
4,5,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Not many games have the cute tag right next to the horror tag on Steam.I first played this game in late 2014 and coming back to it for the first time since. This game is so good for it being free, take advantage and experience it. Try and get to  room 1000 or as close as you can. The further you progress the darker the game becomes.",1,happiness

6,7,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,Great game. it's a cute little horror game that progressively gets darker and scarier. It has a sense of humor too! (I've played it a little but I have watched several people play it and I love it!),1,happiness
7,8,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion is a Free Retro maze game with jump scares and death.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  I took a wrong turn somehow and keep getting killed by a ghostly creature around room 61, i guess i need to restart and take a different route.  Has a retro look, sort of like Castle Wolfenstein or Doom.   Has creepy music and sounds.  It has 1,000 rooms to go through.

8,9,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Somewhere between light hearted, happy parody and being afraid of the dark lies Spooky's House of Jump Scares. You are tasked with the daunting duty of surviving one thousand rooms in this endless first person perspective runner. Each room is no more than a few seconds thanks to a sprint key and the fact that each door counts as a new room. Even then one thousand rooms is still a feat against tedium and needless repetition. There are still things every fifteen or so rooms to keep your interest and at the end of fifty rooms you'll find a save point, but nothing can save you from permanent death at the hands of the foul creatures that live within.On the surface the game has a clean, chipper almost cartoon low budget charm to it. Jump scares are rare and at first it comes in the form of adorable cardboard cutouts of pumpkins, ghosts and skeletons that pop out of the wall accompanied by a sound. Some of the sounds are silly and unfitting other times its screeches to drive chills down your spine. The game excels in the sound department and makes good use of music, ambient sounds and foot steps following you.As you delve deeper through the doors of this dank dungeon, you'll uncover more frightening things and points of intreege. There are plenty of written notes here and there. A few times you'll need to search for a key in a different room, but the other ninety-nine percent of the game is leaving rooms behind forever.The themes of the rooms begin to change from the mundane almost Wolfenstien 3D-esque corridors to metal asylum rooms that give you a flashlight to find your way through. There are purple dungeons, green sewers with glowing scum. Some rooms are coated with slime to slow you own while others have holes in the ceiling as if to give you a feeling of dread that something could pop out.There are a limited amount of rooms and I started to memorize them all. Even the game's crescendo encounters in a vacant room with walkways. There's no way to fall into the dark chasms, it acts as if they were walls, but with this open room you get to see a specific creature that might be following you. Sometimes they can float over the gaps, other times they're stuck trying to walk at you from across the gap so you can get a good look at them when they're harmless.If they touch you three or so times you're dead. You have health that does replenish over time and these big moments are rare and easy to avoid. Just keep running and hope there are no locked doors! They only happen in specific rooms and sometimes the rooms are empty, but it still gives that dreadful feeling.You can tear through these rooms pretty quick about 350 of them in a 45 minute. Your stamina will deplete to give a monster the chance to catch you, but going through a door restores your will to run. Other than that waiting a few seconds will replenish your stamina. Longer rooms hav1e limited visibility. The further out an area is the darker it gets.A few rooms have good diversions or tricks to them. Such as one that turns bright and you need to enter the correct combination of corridors signaled by chimes until you can see the door. Another room is endless darkness with a torch at the end, until its revealed that the torch is merely painted on a black wall. A few times you'll need to search an adjacent room for a key to the one you're in.Every fifty rooms, you take a moment to unwind in an elevator that reminds you to hang in there or have a coffee break. The game makes a good balance of calm moments for each of the few tense situations. Its what keeps you off kilter and never expecting anything. Every two hundred and fifty rooms offers a prize to you. What's in the box? Is it snakes? Is it a jack-in-the-box or is it a note?Truth be told I'm very goal oriented with video games and so Spooky missed its mark for me. The cardboard cutouts get in the way. Being chased by something means that it was no threat since it was already behind me. Perhaps in later rooms it gets more difficult, but this is just easy tedium.  Another room, another room, another room. Then knowing I have seven hundred more rooms and another two hour investment of endless running turns the game into a grind. There's no fear and its too long to endure even with save points. The game reuses its points of interest a few times since it recycles rooms.Another issue I have with the game is getting stuck on edges where I need to push away from a wall to get free and turn a corner. Its more than walls, its on the gaps too. I suppose this is acceptable for a scary game where you get chased, but I'm hung up on these hang ups.One interesting thing the game does have is a stabbing mini game where it looks like you're a ghost in a mall. Its a good diversion from the repetition. There's even a computer that shows you all the creatures in the house. Well most of them at least.The best selling point this game has is that its free. By no means does that make this a good game, but it makes it easier to accept. Its a game that brings you up with charm to tear you down with scares beyond the cheap cardboard cutouts that can litter a hallway every so often. Its just far too repetitive without that much dread or excitement.",0,boredom

15,16,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,Never would have thought something so adorably cute would make me dirty my clothing in such short time.Great simple game where the fear builds up just awaiting for the next screamer on the corner. Plus it's free! Can't go wrong with that.,1,happiness

17,18,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,It's exactly what you think it is. Progress through 1000 rooms of horror in cute style with lots of references to popular creepypastas and games. Definitely worth checking out. And it's free! What else do you need for positive experience? :D,1,happiness

The first 50 rooms are just cute but from room 60 it will just get more and more scary! This is a really great horror game and also it is free! I really think you should give this game a shot if you like to be spooked, if you do not wish to get really >>>>>>> scared I suggest you do not play this game! The first specimen is cute but the rest are really scary and also they will try to kill you and hunt you! Like I said, awesome horror game! If you want a cute game this is not what you are looking for!",1,fear
19,20,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Just played this game for about an hour and it has given me some pretty good scares... T_T Few silly jumps starting but as the game progresses it's harder to avoid the paranoia and tension XDIt's fun indeed :),1,happiness
20,21,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"This game may seem cute, adorble and innocent at first. With the cute scary pop's outs every now and again. I was glad to see a spooky scary skeleton.. But things got a little dark when there was notes laying around and a demon like ghost following you where ever you go until a certian point that is. Not to memtion that there are some dead-ends and tons of spooks. If you're into horror running away types. You might like this. Dispite it being looking like it was made for kids when it wasn't. I'd say 11/12 maybe?But all in all. I enjoy it. It's not alone in the dark or any other scary horror like that. It's as the title says: Spooky's House of Jump Scares. And oh boy, I'm pretty spooked. And I'm not joking. This game actually gave me goosebumps.",1,fear

22,23,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis Game is a bit simple but over all i like it, i've currently reached room 710 as its the farthest this game is currently developed to, as its still being built.its a survival horror game that involves roaming a house with many rooms, i think it merges cute, and scary very well as the cute aspects are not out of place nor are the scary aspects they fit supprisingly well and it's amazing how  under the right criteria the cute pop up scares can acctualy be a effective jump scare.i also quite enjoyed the easter eggs and nods to (alien), (alice in wonderland), (five nights at freddy's)  and who knows what other easter eggs will be added as the game progresses, all in all i give this game 7/10 stars.",1,happiness
23,24,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"One of the best horror games imo. It's free, it's cute and it's ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. At the beggining it's just cute jump scare here, cute jump scare there, open doors and it you start thinking, well, this isn't so bad, I guess. But after your first real horror encounter you began to feel chased everywhere you go. And the cute jump scares are not cute anymore. You know something is after you, and begin questioning wether to continue on or not, but you know that you must. I highly recommend it. It's free, so what are you waiting for? It will be a very pleaseant experience, trust me on that.",1,happiness
24,25,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Cute and Horror do not really mesh well in so many instances in gaming. This is one of those delightful exceptions, even if that's because the cuteness at first is then outshone by genuinly horrible things hunting you.  The 'Jumpscares' in the title comes from cheerful little carnival haunted house-style, wooden, pop up monsters that will appear starting early on.  The real horrors are more of the 'you can't fight it, just learn how it moves and strikes, and try to get away'.  This does not, however, in any way mean the funhouse pop up monsters stop showing up; even if you got used to them before, you are quite likely to get a startle when one springs up in front of you while you're distracted fleeing some lurking abomination.",1,fun
25,26,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"great game for your kids!when your childerent play this game, they learn true important things! like how ghost shouldent be trustedand generator make things bright! but most importantly teaches them math from all those rooms!i highly sugest it for childeren 5-10",1,happiness
26,27,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewAn interesting and quirky experience for me. Almost the entire game involves going through one room to the next, of which there are 1000, some short and straighforward, some longer and more complex, but all being a few seconds long at most. Occasionally, you'll be chased by monsters which, despite coming in many variations, almost universally require you to simply go through rooms as fast as possible until they cease their pursuit. Very few moments require solving puzzles or obtaining keys to proceed, giving the player little reason to explore unless forced to. Because of these characteristics, the game feels like a very long chase sequence and, with 1000 rooms to be overcome before the game is over, it can get very repetitive despite being a very short game, clocking at around 3 hours for completion. Fortunately, there are save spots every 50 (later 100) rooms, which allows the player to take a break if necessary. Difficulty-wise, it's not hard; almost all the monsters can be avoided with little hassle, and it's entirely possible you'll miss several of them depending on how efficient you are at going through the rooms. However, the game leaves little room for error, as the enemies tend to deal high damage and some can even one-hit kill you if they manage to get in close enough. It all depends on how well you can manage to keep to your goal of sprinting and reaching the next door. In regards to atmosphere, it's a blend of humor/cuteness with horror, which can be verified by looking at a few screenshots. The humor consists mainly of cutesy characters and dialogue, which are peppered throughout the gameplay (but become increasingly rarer). The horror portion involves surprisingly disturbing imagery and sounds, most of them from the monsters that chase you, and I didn't find myself detracted from it by the occasional humor, so I believe the game was successful in its atmosphere. In my opinion, that is the highest point of this game - seeing what monsters, environments and dialogue will come next.All in all, if you're a fan of horror games, I'd say give this at least a try. It's different and has a charm to it that I believe adds to the overall experience and makes it quite unique.",1,happiness
27,28,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Starts off rather harmless and cute, and very quickly takes a turn for dark and disturbing. It's not without it's faults, the ending is sort of a let down, and it doesn't really escalate as well as it could.That said, by all means check this game out, especially as its free.and watch out for the skeletonsthey'll get you",1,sadness

Despite the title, the initial appearance of the game isn't that of a horror title, even the first scares that you come across are cutely designed cardboard cutouts that pop out from walls as you walk by. As you progress, the game truly comes into its own, changing the scenery, music and overall atmosphere to continually put you in a state of unease. With a whole host of ""specimens"" trying to scare/kill you, an adorable antogonist, outstanding sound and an ability to deliver an unnerving experience (not to mention the fact that this game is free) should put ths game way up on the lists of anyone looking for a decent horror game.",1,fun

33,34,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Spooky's House of Jumpscares is a horror game, no sense beating around the bush. Although it pretends to be a mockery of games that rely on jumpscares for the first fifty or so rooms, things quickly take a turn for the sinister...The game is not long at all; going through the 1,000 rooms is not as tedious of a task as it seems, as each room can be ran through easily within 6 seconds, slightly more for ""special"" rooms.Gameplay is rather simple: Get to the end of Spooky's maze, and survive whatever lies in the bowels of her home. New monsters are introduced every 75 rooms or so, and after the initial chase sequence, can begin chasing you again at any time through your perilious adventure, always keeping things tense. Special rooms and notes can be found throughout the mansion, hinting at a bigger picture behind Spooky and her house...There are two endings, giving you a reason to play through the story at least twice. If obtaining a high score is your cup of tea, you can try your luck in Endless Mode, which challenges you to go as far as possible into the mansion, with monsters, many new, many old, making an appearance.The DLC, Karamari Hospitial, adds even more horror, with a shorter campaign, five new monsters to avoid, and tons of little secrets to hunt down.I highly recommend this game. Also, check out the HD remaster if you like this game! It adds even more stuff to Spooky's twisted home.",1,fun
34,35,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"This little gem is absolutely pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly terrifying. How? I hear you cry. Surely because of the cutesy graphics it couldn't possibly be scary. Right? WRONG. DEAD WRONG. Ahem. The soft graphics are what the game uses to lull you into a false sense of security. After gaining your trust the game begins piling on the atmosphere like a dumptruck at a...dumptruck convention(?) After the first 50-100 rooms or so it becomes clear that the cutesy cardboard jumpscares aren't the only thing plagueing you as you journey through what quickly becomes a monstrous hellscape born out of your own nightmares. The game also nods and pays homage to most genres of horror and even references some popular horror games such as Five Nights at Freddy's and Resident Evil. The game isn't very long but if you're a coward like me then you'll only be able to play it in short, 200 room bursts.

Sure, the graphics aren't great and the controls are a little off, but this game still has creeped me out to the point where I need a break every once in awhile. Maybe its the story being told or the atmosphere, either way, this game does a good job doing what a lot of PAID games fail to do. Actually SCARE the player.

In different level, different monsters will chase you which makes the game more and more creepy. Therefore, ignore the style of graphics and download the game.

47,48,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewSpooky's House of Jump Scares is worth your time. Being free (as of this review), this is the only benchmark the game has to pass. If it's worth your money, and worth your time, you should play it. While I have very little experience in the horror genre, Spooky's House of Jump Scares is pretty transparent with its premise. There's plenty of cute and lighthearted moments, some jump scares, and a thin thread of plot which goes deeper than the surface level. There are 1000 rooms, so you'll spend most of your time wandering from room to room, taking less than a second to move through one of the many repeated corridors. And, while the enemies are spaced out well enough to keep you interested, they can sometimes be a bit underwhelming. However, there are a couple of genuinely scary moments, and the game has enough charm that you may want to stick around to see it all.If you're looking for simple jump scares this game has you covered, and if you're interested in some horror game mechanics in a boiled-down scenario, check it out.",1,fun

60,61,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"I wouldn't necesarily say I recomend this game fully. The gameplay is very basic, progression from going room to room gets old, and it's not the most terrifying game to hardened horror fanatics. But, if you got some time to kill, it's a fun distraction in short bursts.The game is very emersive. The ambience is very well done, the sound design alone really makes you feel like you're trapped miles below ground in a endless maze. The humor is very entertaining and quirky, which is probably the strongest point of the game. The ""jumpscares"" in the name sake aren't the main point of horror. Instead, they're really kind of the joke of the game. When a real threat shows up, it actually doesn't resort to jumpscares. And the monsters are varried enough to keep it suspensful when you're locked in a chase.The only downside, once again, is that it can get old really fast. Basically you just walk room to room. Every now and then you'll read some notes that parody the ones in other cliche horror games. And the jumpscares get more and more sillier. But, sometimes it can feel like a real chore to play this game during long periods. And I have no real interest to go back and find out how to get the good ending, nor do I really want to spend any money for the DLC. But, all in all, it's kind of fun to switch on every now and then when I want something spooky, but not too spooky.",1,neutral

Hey, as a certain multi-holiday musical once told us ""Life's no fun without a good scare"". So I tried it, and was not disappointed. The jump scares were so good I Noped out after the second ""Specimen"". I then promptly pulled a Lets Play video, because I desperately wanted to see the rest of the game. Now, I plan on going back and facing my fears, because I want to play through the rest.This game blends cutesy artwork and characters with horror in an amazing way.

However if you want my personal experience feel free to read.Now I have little time with this game keep that noted however i've had enough time with it to do a proper review of first impressions. This game starts off as a fun joke with a few cute jump scares, however that mood quickly turns grim. This game does not succeed with it's graphical appearance however the audio and ambience that you overhear quickly makes up for that. This game looks like it's just something some company threw together however if you go into how the monster is announced or how they introduce the new concepts via different room layouts, it quickly makes up for it's lack of looks with well polished audio as well as design. My first impressions of the game within the first 10 rooms was ""This is a joke of a game and dull already."" That was until the audio started tugging at the back of my mind and then I paused for the first time with the most creative surprise I had in a while, it was Spooky casually smiling at you through the static of the screen. The reason I mention this is that it was a well done concept that I can honestly say caught me off guard. So all these little things that stick to the back of your mind as you're going room by room pulled by curiosity leaves me to say that this game is definitely a great one. With it's design and use of just a few simple concepts it makes for a good experience. The last thing i'll mention that I liked that made it stand out from other ""horror"" games is that it right out introduces you the ""player"" as you dive into this house of horror. This makes for the fact that you directly are introduced, meaning there isn't some dull protagonist that you're hiding behind.Pros: 1:Audio/SFX is well polished and well used.2:Design is different than what i've encountered in the past as well as well thought.3:It slowly takes you deeper into the horror and leads to a climactic build up that was well done from my experience.4:Gives a nostalgic vibe with the room designs as well as environment.5:The game is Free to Play and a well done F2P game at that.Cons:1:Movement was quite odd and clunky at a few segments.2:Does not take kindly to players with a lower DPI 3:Textures were bland and reused makes for a dull expirience till the climax. However this minorly impacts the game.4:Lack of pull factors other than Spooky, and Curiosity and arguably the ambience.Mixed Factors:1:Voice acting was a double edged sword, on one hand it was cute and well presented on the other it wasn't executed properly. I personally enjoyed it, but other's could be turned away from the game with such a presentation.Overall Ratings:SFX/Audio 9/10Design 8/10Voice Acting 7/10Gameplay 6/10Character Introduction 8/10Graphic/Texture Rating 4/10Overal Rating 7.5/10(Keep in mind this is a F2P game)I know this rating doesn't make it seem like a must play game. However for it being Free and so well designed it is worth a try at the very least. I would recommend this game to anyone of my friends in a heartbeat. Keep in mind though that this game immerses you via it's audio cues as well as it's climactic build up. If these factors do not interest you or if you're looking for a fast paced action game this is most likely not going to be something you will enjoy.",1,fun

The only issue I have with the game is the screen moving downwards and to the left occasionally but it was easy to get past. I wish I could take screenshots to share with friends but print screen works just as well as a substitute. Definitely give the game a chance if you have the time since it's free. I really hope to get one of my friends to play the hd remake in VR someday (cause I'm not gonna do it).",1,fun

Let's jump right to it then, shall we?In my Opinion is this Game quite enjoyable, at least if you don't try to not find it scary. Some Game Mechanics are pretty neat, as for example, the Fact that One can open Doors while walking backwards is something I'd like to see in more Games. I also appreciate CAT-DOS as Source of Background Information a great Deal.  But those are just small Details. I think what defines a Horror Game is the Atmosphere, and that is a very strong Point of this Title. Especially the Music is most of the Time on spot.The Enemy variety is okay for the Amount of Playtime and the the Graphics are pretty cute-ish when it comes to the Surroundings.I also might add that this Game has an pretty interesting Sense of Humor, which is normally not to be expected from a Horror Title.

There may be a refund for money now on steam, but no refund for wasted time!",0,anger
135,136,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Not that scary but still fun! Don't know what to say about it really. I know many will get scared by it and I guess it gets scarier later on but yeah. Try it out. You'll notice if you like it or not. :),1,fun
136,137,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,really the game was fun early on but after play it to room 300 you get this puppet that follows you and cant get away from he just hits you when ever and it makes it impossible to get past the small scares get boring this game is kinda a waste of time i do not recomend it. ,0,anger

The virtual epitome of blue balls.

166,167,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,"This game puts great humor in horror. It gets dark in some areas and has the tendency to scare you with things you will be ashamed to admit have scared you. The progression of the rooms feels repetitive, but this is perfect to get the player off guard to hit them with, you guessed it, a jumpscare. Whether the scare be a puppet, a deer, a spider, or even a cup of tea, everything in this game does a good job at scaring someone their first playthrough or so. The style of it makes it one of the cutest and creepiest scary games you can play.",1,fun

168,169,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"This game makes no sense. The visuals are adorable and cute, but I can't help but jump out of my skin whenever a cardboard cut out pops out of a wall with a hideous sound effect. This game has atmosphere in bucket loads. I couldn;t help but keep sprinting, even when the scary music and the monsters that chase you stop. If you're a fan of tense horror games, I'd say this one's definitely worth a go. It is free after all!",1,happiness

170,171,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewHoly Hell! Give this thing your full attention if you are at all interested in the horror genre. Despite the name, the game is only sparsely reliant on simple jump scares and instead paints a truly horrific atmosphere of dread, tension and tongue-and-cheek satire. It's a really good sign when you're on pins and needles at the mere prospect of opening a door. I found this one thoroughly difficult to put down for long. Seriously, This programmer deserves a friggin' medal!--Plus, the low res graphics make the visuals doubly creepy. Bonus!",1,happiness

172,173,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"Product received for freei love this game. I like the specimens, ALL the specimens, and i thought this game was scary and cute.

179,180,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"After seeing a negative review of this game,even though the majority like it,I wanted to make a review talking about what a GREAT horror game this is.First of all,it's free.I really see no reason why you shouldn't get it just to try it out.Karamari Hospital (The DLC) costs just under $6,but if you enjoyed the game I would recommend the dlc.Now,I'm gonna get into the main review.The game itself does have a lot of references,but that's what makes it great.The game doesn't feel like it ""stole"" these concepts from anything,the closest it gets to other games/movies is slight references.1.If you find jump scares scary.GET THIS GAME.2.If you are unsure,try watching Markiplier or someone play it,that's how I found out about it.Just make sure you only watch a bit,so that the game still has some surprises.3.I found I rarely died from enemies,but that was because I was absolutely terrified of them,and wouldn't get near them.TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE ENEMIES!!(I won't say them all,just some stuff to know)(Possible Spoilers)Specimen 1.The main specimens take the form of cardboard cut outs,at first they aren't scary,but later into the game,I began to fear them more then the actual enemies.They jump scare you,but the do it ALL the time,and it's terrifying.Specimen 2 and 3 chase you around,they aren't the scariest.I skipped a bit of the game,(I'm gonna replay it all soon),so I missed the specimen 4 and 5 parts.They still look spooky though.Specimen 6 is well...The bane of my existence.Specimen 6 is probably one of the scariest monsters in the game,as he will stalk you down,and slaughter you.His death screen terrified me,and his area contains a lot of Zelda references,which I quite enjoyed.Just,when you play the game,BE READY FOR SPECIMEN 6.Specimen 7 isn't really scary.But it confuses you,and makes chase's with other monsters MUCH HARDER.Specimen 8 is the deer god.Things in his area start out fairly un-scary,but then 8 shows up,and the terror begins.Although not one of the scariest,he is probably on the most memorable.Specimen 9 randomly appears if you spend too long in a room.I have never encountered him before,[spoileri] He re-appears as the final boss of the game,whom you battle with an axe.It is fun,and similar to the Ganon battle from LOZ:OOC.[/spoileri] Specimen 10 is featured in a cool 'futuristic' area.I don't entirely remember him,but I remember he is VERY hard to run away from.Specimen 11,who I refer to as the 'beef god',is one of the scariest enemies in the game.I remember him from let's plays of the game,so maybe I was just nervous when I entered his area.The area he is in is a fast food restaurant area.There is a lot to do before meeting him,but it is very unnerving,especially since the music is terrifying.Specimen 12 the 'old man' or 'the mansion' is one massive room.It takes the place of a mansion,where you complete various tasks while running from the 'old man'.It was very fun,and scary.Specimen 13 who I call 'the siren' is a monster very similar to Kaernk from 'Amnesia:The Dark Descent'.You must frantically run to different crates floating in a flooded room in order to escape the siren.It was really fun,and the area before was very scary.That raps up the review of the monsters,but I have a few more things to say.1.The game doesn't have amazing graphics,but that kinda adds to the horror.2.The game has A LOT OF REFERENCES,which is one of the best parts of the game.3.THIS GAME IS TERRIFYING.(atleast if jumpscares scare you :3)I would definitely recommend this game.10/10  ",1,happiness

181,182,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,"The only scary thing about this game is that the developers thought that slowly walking around opening doors with interjections of comically-horrendous jump scares every 10 minutes would somehow be playable. It's not.I originally played this game at a friend's, which meant I had to install the game on my own machine and play for 5 minutes in order to be eligible to write a review. I imagine the feeling is similar to that of visiting an uncle that abused you as a child. My non-masochistic nature screamed at me to stop, but I felt I had an obligation to bridge some of the unprecedented gap between the game's reviews and its quality.",0,hate
182,183,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"The game has fun and spooky moments but most of the time is spend walking through the same rooms over and over again which makes it extremely boring. Every 100 rooms (=1floor), there are generally 2 or 3 stuff happening, a big room (which is actually multiple rooms) with spooky stuff, a monster running after you in the regular rooms near the end of the floor, and some notes left by some dude for you to read. Otherwise you're just walking through the same rooms over and over. Sometimes you think a room is important but it's actually just a regular room with nothing special. Oh and jump scares.But when you're not walking through the randomly chosen clone rooms the game has some good ideas.Hopefully it's free but the sections where nothing happens are so long that you're wondering if you're not paying the game with your time.",0,boredom

After 300 rooms it just felt like this was a hallway simulator with a rare jump scare. You would think with a name like House of Jump Scares that it would have too many, but no, it doesn't really have too much of anything except hallways.

188,189,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI have completed the game and got the bad ending.I've also gotten the other ending.This game starts out really terrifying, with the music and graphics. But it only gets worse, Monsters will start chasing you and sounds will creep you out. At points you are tested on various tasks of survival. There are many wonderful things I could talk about Spooky's. Specimen 4 is one of my favorite enemies in the entire game, the red bloody claws and calm behavior make her awesome.Spoiler warning:The late game really tests your patience and observance, stalkers, water monsters, long halls and very awkward corridors make the monsters who get faster later on more challenging. You will make mistakes ultimately leading to your death if you're not careful. Seriously! This game can get fairly challenging at points. I like it when games add challenge which the game lacked when it wasn't finished. The game is still fair once you know what you're doing. I also enjoyed the bad ending.Overall I find players may appreciate this game for what it is.",1,happiness

191,192,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Short review for a cute but short ""Spooky"" horror game. Spooky's House of Jump Scares is a indie 1st person walking simulator, you take on the role of an historian on an expedition to explore a strange castle. After this you're given little to no explanation other than the odd notes found through the game. The game basically boils down to open door, proceed through room open next door. It gets old really, really fast. To keep things interesting, the game throws some new enemy types (which I honestly couldn't tell apart from the others) and they spice things up with the rooms. The biggest problem with this game is repetition, I think somewhere around 70-80% of rooms are always empty and are basically the same. It's really boring to be honest, and even the ocasional jump-scare won't impress you after you realise you spent 3-4 hours pressing E to proceed in a ""horror"" game. It had some interesting ideas to it, but it's just too boring to play. I guess if they made the rooms more random it would have been ok, but eh. It still feels boring and bland to play, it's ok for the first 15-20 minutes but don't expect much to change.The good:Good audioDecent atmosphereThe Bad:Lackluster gameplayRepetitive roomsLack of variety overallBoringA 4/10 at best",0,boredom
192,193,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a game that I would have spend $10 dollars to buy. First of all, it's a completely new concept for a horror game that completely blew my mind. Also, the variety of monsters in this game is superb, and all of them equally terrifying. I must say though, the puppet was the most terrifying since it reminded me of the weeping angels from Dr. Who (yes, I am a nerd, I know that.) Conclusion? Download the game! It's amazing, it's free, and an excellent horror experience!

194,195,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's a great game with plenty of things to scare you. The scariest for me are the violent deer and that Deer God thing. The game would be better if it had full controller support. Other than that, it's perfect! It's startling, scary, and spine tingling. Not for the average gamer. Oh, and if you though Five Nights at Freddy's was bad, try this. Have fun!",1,fear
195,196,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"Just finished the game and while it does have quite an atmosphere to go on as well as the music, the game do become rather repetetive with the rooms. From what I understand the rooms that are not scripted are randomized and yield different results.The specimens were unique in their own ways, but they weren't too much of an issue once you understand how each work and can deal with them with rather ease.The stories that you learn throughout the game have no lasting appeal in the game, they happen and once you get past one it's over and is forgotten suddenly.Playing through the game by making it past 1000 rooms is not worth it, you're not rewarded with the endeavours you go through, it's basically just a non-standard game over anyway where you accomplish nothing, i.e., just a bad ending.On another note, it is indeed for free so you could give the game a go and see for yourself whether you'd like the game or not.

I loved it just going through 1000 rooms from being cute to freakin terrifing it really is a great game, but thier is one thing about the game that I really hate and i hope you will change it in the future I mean it is still in early access and im sure thiers still things that you need to fix but what I dont like is the ending becuase throughout the game besides trying to survive Im always thinking of what heppen to this place or what was this place and who was Spooky really also what were they exactly doing here it was the mystery that also really kept me going through the game and I just couldent wait to see what happens at the end and dreams crushed Spooky was creating an army and all the shadow people were people before me to go in the mansion but I was confused becuase I still dont know what exactly this place was or what they were doing or how Spooky became well Spooky and you didnt even explained why she was creating an army what was the purpose of all of this is thier going to be a second game that explains all of ths (a prequal) or is that really it cause I really got into the game but then boom worst ending ever all of that all of what i was trying to figure out was for nothing. no offence but ending was worst then Outlast (person your playing dies after all that youve done in the game).",1,hate

212,213,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a very unique and great game. The reason I love it is it scares me so badly and yet I am determined to finish it. What this game does, is it sets you in a false sense of security, makes you feel like one room is safe and okay, and then when you go to the next room it rips you to pieces with its terrifying jumpscares. From the monsters (I HATE YOU WEEPING ANGEL PUPPET MASTER YOU SCARE ME TO BITS BUT ITS AWESOME) to the cute little jumpscares, this game has it all. If you enjoy horror and things that can really set you in the right mood to want to scream, then check this game out. I don't recommend it to people who are susceptible to heart attacks, because this game could cause one if you don't take a break every now and then, but other than that this game is awesome, and I love it.

214,215,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"The best way for me to describe this game is as a much need satire of the horror genre. Experienced as if you're playing the history of the genre from the worst of the newest, to the best of the classics.Starts out with the very worst of the genre the modern cheap jumpscare tactics, and slowly brings in tropes from classic games making it better and better the more rooms you go through.The DLC while not neccesary, itself is a homage to PT/silent hills, even going so far as to have ""RIP Konami"" in the credits.Everything good and wrong with this genre in one game. 10 out of 10",1,happiness

I MEAN IT!!!!WARNING!!!it can cause Epilepsy, Diarrhea, Eyebags, and HEART ATTACKFirst of all I give my respect of the creator of this game you have created one of the most cute/scary game in the steam.

ART - I really tell you its amazing from cuteness to horrofiying 9.2/10Sound - when going to a different room its Sound effects changes I really like that 9.7/10Character voice - I haven't heared other character voice except the ghost girl ..... well its pretty good 9/10Horror - 8.9/10 (Medium rating) pop-up only gets me scared ..... well sometimes the chasers too gets me xDI really appreciate if you would add more chasers that would get you heart more pumping.",1,happiness

I love the references I have found in the game so far and the easter eggs :D the deeper you delve the more this becomes a master piece!

THIS WAS THAT GAME. Now I saw it in the store and thought ""Hmmm wtf is this kids game"" But my curiosity of course led me to clicking on it. I was surprised by it's fantastic reviews. So I of course decided to give it a look. Upon entering this game you're thrown into door simulator 2015. At around room 30 I was hit with my first jump scare. A small cardboard cut out of a tree. Now, this doesnt seem like much until you understand I literally had to take a 30 second break, I was so panicked. Granted I'm not very good at dealing with horror but still. After finally completing the game, being chased by the most horrifying monsters with the most horrifying effects through changing terrain and a variety of different twists, I found myself nearly screaming with every new twist. This is not a kids game boys. Buckle up and prepare your body's because this game holds back nothing in it's efforts to make you jump out of your skin.",1,fear

But after an hour of ""this room again,"" it started becoming very grating to see the same things and hear the same 'spooky creaky door' soundbytes.  As for the actual content in the rooms that weren't empty, the reviews oversold the game for me; I was really expecting something more as I progressed, but that expectation never materialized.I think this game could be something really good, but as of right now, it could absolutely stand to be pared down to 500 rooms of cute terror.

237,238,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game made me want to run away from my computer and never turn it back on again. It's surprising how scary a game, that looks like it was made in 1995, can be. You end up sprinting through every room knowing that if you stay still for just a moment you're likely to get ripped to peices and some horrible annimation will come up on the screen that would be enough to give your children future mental issues and kill off your grandma. So you run and you run, even from the sounds coming from everywhere, and you run straight into a guy that wants to put a pin through your eyeball and turn you into one of his puppets. My advice would be: Assume everybody and everything wants to kill you, don't explore, just run as fast as you can... Into a cardboard cut-out of a pumpkin that will jump out at you, and that in any other situation wouldn't be all that bad, but here it makes you fall backwards off your chair. Oh and don't look behind you; all you will see is a guy with a machete trying to hack you up, or a ghost girl that want to eat your brain, or some green guy that for some reason seems really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off with you as if you haven't got enough on your plate already.

I think it peaked out at 750 rooms, but I continued till about 1021 before deciding to quit. Don't judge this game by its silly appearance...

Yet we all keep coming back for more?  Great game and the price is better.  I would gladly have paid $10 for this game, however it was FREE!  1000 rooms, jump scares and a great story too?
