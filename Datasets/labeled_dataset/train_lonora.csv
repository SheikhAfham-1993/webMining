751,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis game is basically a CS:GO rip-off. But because CS:GO isn't a good game, its rip-off cannot be good. However I recommend you play this if your computer is equipped with a pentium 4 and you have some friends with pentium 4 machines around. Beware of hackers though ;D ",1,happiness

754,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewLets just start by saying this game sucks.The menu has nothing nice about it; it's a complete eyesore. The graphics look like they were done in 2006 and there is no antialiasing even when aa is turned on. The guns take too long to actually deal a decent ammount of damage to players. They also feel crappy to shoot due to the lack of characteristic and the ammount of input lag thrown into the mix.The buy menu is horrid to look at and use.Ecosystem in team deathmatch?Not that the ecosystem actually works or anything.Full of 14 year olds.Full of hackers. Hell, I can't actually believe that someone took some time out of their everyday life to develop a hack.I doubt the hacks are being countered anytime soon anyway since the last time the game was updated was October.This game is dead, put it out of its misery.",0,anger

756,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke, only play it with a couple of your buds and have a few laughs. The game itself is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible its trying too much to be like CS:GO. The player hitboxs are too large, the knives don't even work, the guns aren't balanced as firing shotgun rounds to people up close take 3 shots and you can get one shoted by an ak47 with full armor and health. Let's just leave it and give this game a 10/10 would fail again at stabbing people with knives.",1,happiness
757,WARMODE,2015,Early Access ReviewI have fun playing this game. Very easy learning curve for FPS loving gamers. It's like poor mans CS:GO. But the Game is Buggy & not balanced at all. Recommended if you want some quick fun. How to play:1. Get three kills with your Glock2. Buy AK3. Get more kills & buy Kevlar4. Get more kills & buy Grenade5. Control Mid with your Team mates6. Go close to Enemy Spawn point 7. Have fun ,1,fun

764,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewI believe this game has some of the most potential Ive seen in a long time, the only problem is, I believe this game was realeased in such a sorry state.

768,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis game it may not be the best but i can say that it is a cs:go training ground, its mostly like csgo but much harder now it may have bugs like shooting from the hit and hit the headshot from hitting his arm but hey it will be fixed but, the dmg is realistic its not terrible its an early acces hopefully the dev wont ditch this game like many did i recommend it its good dont rage from it btw its filled with russians that dont spam you with mics that they are actually nice so fun game over all 9/10",1,happiness
769,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewWhat can I say? Its a COD and CSGO clone, only worse. I cant imagine what they were thinking. Releasing this god forsaken game, even in beta, to the public. Its full of everything that COD and CSGO have. Head Glitchers, Spawncampers (The spawns are preset, and they can shoot you when you spawn, no protection besides 2 seconds of invincibility), and terrible hit boxes. The hit boxes are really wonky, I have to aim at their feet in long range gun fights to hit them. And it gives me a headshot. I dont know what they were thinking with this game. I know for a fact they are adding, or have already added microtransactions. This is a cheap way for them to make easy money. With the popularity of Call Of Duty, and CSGO combined, this will of course gain popularity. I just hope people make smart choices in not investing in this game, for it will increase theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥list games that have made aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of money! so please, dont bother with this game, or you will cause a plague that will make the game industry go hay-wire.",0,anger
770,WARMODE,2015,Early Access Review1. Easy To run2. Easy to download light on the Hard-drive space3. Spas 12 is fun to charge around with4. They made the most exspensive gun the best.5 Would spam PKP- Headshots again 10/10Also I don't play that Much ;),1,happiness
771,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewEh..with the game being in early access I pretty much expected bugs,etc. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy this game,but this game needs quite a bit of improvement.First off,we need better servers or at least be able to see what the ping on the server is,i'm annoyed with entering in to a server and it lagging quite hard on me time to time and going back to smooth,etc.What ever you do,DON'T aim down your sights! I experimented with it and when I was aiming at an enemy with my iron sights right on the person just to see all my bullets flying up in to the sky shooting the roof of the building. So you might as well just shoot from the hip.If you get shot in the head with any gun pretty much,you'll fall over dead every time,so if you run across a hacker.aimbotter there is gonna be no way to exactly even be able to get enough time to even kill them,besides the fact this game has a spawn kill element in it,Though on the bright side,at least it isn't P2W and you get a large variety of guns,but you just need to be able to get plenty enough kills to earn the money in order to have the guns you want,as my personal favourite is the ASVAL. So despite the lag and spawn kill element,the game can be quite fun and possibly have potential in the near future..so I guess I can recomend it,I atleast had a lil bit of fun on the game.

772,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewPure garbage. Players that are impossible to kill. Insta-respawn in the same spot to get revenge if you kill them. Total garbage. Uninstalling this piece ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Good thing I didn't have to pay for it. No NA servers, all RU & EU.",0,anger
773,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis game is really fun, but the hackers make it worse, the 'Voting' System is garbage! I keep getting 'Voted"" Off because I play to well, can't you like have modders, so when there is a hacker you call a modder to ban/kick the player. Anyway, voting off a player will only kick him from 1 game, so you can encouter the player again anytime. So please Warmode creators, fix this or I will stop playing.

776,WARMODE,2015,Early Access ReviewAlthough i have only played this for few minutesI would recommend this game to you first of all because its free and small only about 200MB there is no reason not to try itit is not P2W The only thing we must pay for is the badges and mask which are pure cosmetics no buffs or anythinggame is like CS with Aim down sight all weapons are unlcockjust picture this CSGO with no skins and with slightly low graphicif the Developers are reading this please add team balance because in my first match i was the mercs with 4 other players againts 2 player and add a feature so that you can create your own serveragain you can try this game for yourself because it is free and small if u dont like it just uninstall it ,1,happiness

779,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewI have no idea why the dev released this game in this state. its broken. period. weapons are not balenced. serers are extreamly laggy. the only redeaming quality is the fact that even though this game features a store, you cant buy anything that puts pure free player at a disatvantage. Was this game fun? yes it was. does that mean its a good game? no.-=Gameplay=-This game makes me think of counter-strike and COD had a baby and somehow that god aweful game Combat Arms also came in. It plays alot like Counter-Strike, you only get weapons by killing other players and getting points. But the problem lies in the fact that the servers are so laggy you cant ever get a kill. not to mention aiming seems to be slightly off when you use your aim down sights. there is only 1 U.S server and for the most part my connection to each server remained crap. Now dont get me wrong, i did enjoy some of the matches. but its hard to denie this game has alot of flaws that quite honestly are un-exseptable. The maps feel bland. you can see obvious choke points and sections where most players are going to be. but these highly populated areas are the only place there tends to be any action. Spawn camping is another big problem. if the enemy team has more players you can bet your gonna get spawn camped. -=Sound=-The game tends to be glitchy at times. the guns also dont sound all that amazing. the music you here when you start up the game is nice. but after that is all guns. and thats fine...if the guns were nice to hear. -=Community=-With this being a pure online based game i have to adress community. the community is....there. but its not booming. i havent seen too much ""hacker"" name calling while in a game as of late. but when thegame was first released, it was somthing you saw alot.-=Free or Pay2Win=-This game does feature a store so the dev can get alittle cash dollar. but theres no guns,ammo,or anything that would make it pay 2 win. what is there is slight cosmetic gear. such as face pain and masks. -=Graphics=-The graphics are not anything new, exciteing, or all that special. but they are not the worst. i can deal with the graphics if the gameplay is good. -=Final verdict=-This game is fun, and with more work could be great. but at its current state i just cant reccomend it. the only way i would recomend this game is if there was some way to host your own servers/games and let others join. that would atleast help with the god aweful conection quality of the current servers. The Final verdict is a 3.75/5.0 (okay)",0,hate
780,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewRight now the game is buggy, unpolished, etc. But with a bit of work this game could turn into a real gem. Before that can happen it needs a variety of servers not just American and Russian e.g. Asian, Australian, General Europe. Would not recommend the game to anyone at the moment, but like I said maybe in a few months when it's more polished with more servers.",0,anger

785,WARMODE,2015,Early Access Review       Its a very fun FPS game. (Better then CS:GO) This is a shotter game made for new people to FPS games.  Everywepon shots in a stright line tere is no recoil so you can keep shooting till your Clip/Mag runs out.  In other games a primary is stronger then a secondary but not in this game every gun is OP which makes it better if you forgot to buy something.  The servers are full with people good game and nice graphics this game looks like what cod was intendaed to be back then.The thing i alot of people hate about this game is the shotgun that sprays and has long range yes everyone has used it but everyone has hated it.this game is a 7/10 Fun game i will spray again if you pray again SPRAY AND PRAY,1,fun

787,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis game is a First Person Shooter if you havent noticed already. I have to say that this game is a rip-off of CS:GO but lacks the depth like planting bombs and such. I only played this game because a Steam friend of mine parted with his sanity and played this game so much that he changed his Steam name to 'WARMODE KING'. I wrote this review to save you from such dark actions.Because this is a PC game Graphics are everything, but this game does not deliver in this respect. It resembles a potato on methamphetamine quite well. The objects and environment are of low quality and the textures are sub-par. The animations aren't horrible but they take to long to complete, for example i might go to shoot an enemy but they are already dead and i cant see this because the death animation takes to long to finish.The maps are terrible and arent very detailed, with few static environmental objects. They also lack complecity and are far off something such as CS:GO.To be honest i cant be bothered writing a review for this game its not worth the pain and regretful gameplay. Just save your life from a slow death from this game and just buy CS:GO. ",0,hate
788,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis takes the cake for the worst fps on steam. When you open the menu, The screen flips vertically, the map constanly turns white. But wait theres more!!

DO NOT BUY!Plus the scope doesn't even work and when I started up the game it was playing at 480p so I had to change the resolution while not even being able to read the words for the settings so I just had to click on some random stuff and eventually got it to 1080p.Well I have to admit the scope does actually work but you can't see through the scope so if it do ever get this game (which you shouldn't) you will have to play it like CS:GO but you will fail and that is why I deleted the entire game after only 0.2 hours messing with the resolution and mouse sensitivityDon't buy,0,anger
794,WARMODE,2015,Early Access ReviewThis game is awesome but they have to create asia servers so we can avoid intense lag on EU servers.CS:GO kids will hate this game becouse the game looks a bit like itOverall 10/10Will make it 10 when they get better serversEdit:They improved servers and there is rarely any lag.I did never thought a 250-270 mb game can be this good.Definetly play it.,1,happiness

I think the gameplay is the best and very good variety of weapons, the bad thing is the ugly design on character skins, small maps and servers are not online all the time and all of them are from RU (when they are online). The maps really looks like to csgo choke points maps, some will remember you to dust2 so much. I do recommend it since is a very good game to play for free and not get frustrated, since it is a very fair game.HERE IS WHAT I THINK THIS GAME NEEDS TO BE A BEAST:*Bigger maps.*Up servers 24h.*New Skins / voice chat.*Clean design on hud, fonts, menus.*Player all time stats.*Private / lan servers*Workshop",1,surprise

806,WARMODE,2018,"Early Access ReviewOmgThis game shouldn't even be on steam but in some ""Beta Section"".This game isn't finished at ALL!I hope it was a combination of CS1.6 and Call of Duty, because it look like it.This game could be awesome but it's really trash. Sound is bugged, the footsteps sound like everyone had only 1 leg and legs out of wood. The ADS is also trash because it's click to ADS not ""HOLD TO ADS"" i hate the hold to ADS function, never use it. Many times i wonder how i hit headshots doing leg shots but okay. There is some sort of bug when you crouch and someone runs under you you jump up idk but i died because of this to many times.This game:Idea 8/10 (very good)gameplay 3/10 (very bad)You don't even know why you kill people.",0,anger
807,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access Review10/10 glimpse into the situation russia is in. The shadows are the most unique thing ive ever seen while the story is crispe and incredible and extremely sad at the end I wont spoil it. The character models shine almost as much as the great gameplay, and the story compliments the beutiful gameplay. The gameplay is so great that Ive had multiple hours of staring at the main menu screen with awe while I saw the beutiful graphics of the play button shine into my soul. The buttons are so rectangular that ive always imagined spongebob jumping into them and wearing them as pants. The character's have great voice acting and the back stories are so sad that I don't want to spoil it for you. The reflections into the water are so beautiful that my eyes gush out blood and spew onto my dead cat (My cat died because I played this game for 12 hours straight one time and needed to eat my cat to feed myself because I just couldnt stop playing this beautiful game) (I now have battle scars). This game will always leave beautiful memories of me shooting the same character model in the face precisely 18/5 times before he eventually died and blood spews everywhere and myÃ¢â¢Â¥Ã¢â¢Â¥Ã¢â¢Â¥Ã¢â¢Â¥Ã¢â¢Â¥Ã¢â¢Â¥Ã¢â¢Â¥gets hard. Before I play the game I slap my leg 3 times and screech so that warmode god will finally except me. When I finish a match of this game I throw my headset precisley 13/5 miles so that the warmode god doesn't kill me next time I slap my leg. Overall this game is the most beautiful game anybody will ever play if you do not agree with my review I will take my cats left over remains and smear them on your face until you call me daddy and start to pray to the warmode god. After that I will sacrafice you to the warmode god for accepting his overall beautifulness. Than I will continue to slap my leg. (Still not better then uncrowded)",1,happiness

So, if you are a CS:GO fan I think you will really enjoy this game. The maps are kinda small but have enough room to move around. I hope this game gets some more maps and some extra class stuff like med packs and different knives would be cool. It is strangely addicting and it's free so you don't have anything to lose from trying it. My rating would be a 7/10.",1,happiness
811,WARMODE,2015,Early Access ReviewThis game sucks. First you start out with the pistol then if you want to get to any good gear you have to kill poeple and the bad thing is that you can't even put your own favorite weapon in you'r beggining weapon of the begining of the game.,0,anger

814,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis game is ok so far (also CS:GO / Cod crossover) by that I mean the lighting effects have been finally fixed and playermodels look better now.

825,WARMODE,2017,"Early Access ReviewFirst game was mainly learning the ropes and how to control my dude after a 1 second flash of controls. No tutorial. No campaign. This game is honestly really boring. The second game I played was just people running round kifing. I can honestly say that I've never wanted to shutdown my computer, get some gas, pour it on the computer, light it on fire, pee on it and go buy a computer with windows XP so much. Then the third game, oh man i spawned and just died over and over again from a dude with a glock. At first i thought he was just really good. But after waiting in spawn with no enemy in sight, watching your entire team die from hackers was very great. I think I had more fun than Minecraft and Roblox's offspring game called 'I wanna die'. The guns are fun but the game is perfect. Totally. I just wissh there were more hackers so that I continually can't play. FIX THE GAME.

826,WARMODE,2015,Early Access ReviewIf you dont mind getting killed and not able to get a kill because of the stupid lag of all players and possible hackers in this game then I HIGHLY DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS GAME. There is more lag in this game than all online games that have lag put together trust me when I say I dont like or play games that have lag. I do play games that have lag but nothing compared to the amount of lag in this game. Steam would do us gamers a favor by taking this trash off the steam market of games.,0,hate

830,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewThe worst FPS I ever played, and I have PLAYED A LOT! from Prject Black out to Call of Duty, CG:SO, all those twitchy squad shooters. Now this...this actually makes me want to installa notorious P2W game than play this poor game. Ok, well I give it this: It tries to be ""equal"". IF any one is familiar with Begone, a Unity based squad shooter for free, this is the same thing. you log in, load up on kill credits and pay at spawn for armor, grenades etc... so it starts most people off equal and you build up as the match stays open...I personally like that than hard load outs. But this game losses all points when :1) The maps feel baby block desing. Hard to explain but super simple mushy non thinking, turn here fire. 2) Because of this design the damage and hit detectioni is so off. It feels like you are getting hit by paintballs. But problem is, I played better paintball sims. You can walk up and unload two full clips to peoples head and I guess there is a RNG where sometimes it is a headshot, and other times you just slowly reload, and refire. It is soo bad. It just feels so fake and silly....It gives it charm though. If you are tired of one shot kills ing ames like CS:Go and doubt who is a hacker or or skilled... play this, no doubts, everything is pillow fight calculations. You can swing, hit a head, but sometimes you get em RIGHT in the eye. 3) Buggy. This is what happened: I log in, play a round, ok, earn enough to buy a grenade, found out it is cool, you buy it once, don't need to rebuy each spawn. Game ended, I quit the match, joined a new server to get new group of guys. And it says I have 1 grenade in the bottom right. I thought, oh cool. I use it, nothing happens, die. ""Oh a bug. That makes sense I don't have one, I jsut started and don't have the kill credits yet..."" I can live with that bug. So I go back out, decide to do a wall clip shot, you know, you shoot the edge of the wall as you edge out to get anyone hiding behind wall and use your own cover fire....I die....Who killed me? me.... I somehow killed myself....I can only guess this the ricochet off the wall....Like, this game is either so great! SOG EPIC that it calculates deadly ricochet into my skull, or it is so pathetically failing at being an FPS that it has no idea itself as  a game who killed me... I uninstalled on match 2, I can no longer continue. Pure cancer. Oh yeah, before I left, I hung out in match a little longer because I noticed a lot of russians with high knife score in a gun battle. I saw a guy passing walls, floating, and invisibble 1 shotting with a knife....hacked cancer, the worse there is. Seriously, you can get a BETTER experience on a web based shooter called: Begone.",0,anger

839,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewOkay.. listen up. This game? It's a whirlwind. I played it a WHILE ago, and can tell you it was pretty fun. NOw that doesn't mean I would have recommended this game over counter-strike... even for the free price tag. But it was fun, broken and fun. After an mmmmm 5 Month Hiatus, I've come back to it.. and no surprise whatsoever, it got worse. Before I get into that, I am going to tell you what they had going for them.-Broken spawn traps.-Unbeleiveabley unbalanced guns.-small and crowded maps.-And sub-par servers-okay graphics... like ps2...NOW... they tried to fix that.-Spawn protection...-The guns have been ""balanced"" (on the edge of a cliff with everything on one side)-.... New maps...-Servers that no longer tell you your ping.. Now you're left wondering if that knife death was because you were lagging, or because the game decided that a ten foot knife was now in the game..-graphics that make my computer couch and weeze when I try to load it in 720p... early ps1The game ( when I got it) was a Mixture of CS:GO and C.O.D and it was broken beyond belief, but it was fun. you could go 80-0 with your friends and not care about anything. It may be early access but I don't think that going backwards is how you make a game. I know That I am rambing, but I guess this could be geared more towards the makers of the game. if you see this, go back a few months, figure out what you want with this game, and build from there.For those of you that feel like getting this game before CS:GO.... Don't. Get csgo first and then ty this game out. Drop a thirty bomb in casual, or TDM. then get the game.",0,fun

852,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewIt's very rare that I am unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game I don't like. Wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game.....I mean this game is bad and I mean REALLY BAD! The map designs feel like someone is just painting by the numbers adding in only the most basic and mundane boring, bland landscape imaginable. Oh let's not forget when I logged in for the very first time, I received a machine gun volley of invites from every single random person imaginable. I literally got 35 invites within the first minute of logging in which was enragingly annoying. I could not find the settings menu fast enough to turn off notifications. An option such as that should be turned off by default seeing how a new player could get spammed into the ground with invites before they even put their foot in the door. My gosh never has a game had such atrocious hit detection/registry in all my years of gaming. Aiming in this game is a bad joke and attempting to aim with ironsights is just dogs***. I lined up a target in my ironsights, took precise aim at my oppenent's head and opened fire like crazy only to find out I DID NOT HIT HIM ONCE! So throughout the match I sat there trying to figure out where the hit detection/registry allowed me to damage my opponents. And of all the ridiculous solutions I've found this has got to be the worst. I found out how to make headshots in this game using ironsights. The trick is you don't aim for their head when trying to make a headshot (I know I'm just as confused and surprised as you are by that fact). You aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent's chest to make headshots which is a**backwards and makes no sense what so ever.And then there is the blatant hacking in this game in which I gotta say wow. People who hack in this game are WAY TOO COMFORTABLE in cheating. From what I've seen these hackers walk around like ""Yeah I'm cheating....The f*** you gonna do about it?!"" In some instances they don't even try to hide the fact that they are cheating which is amazing in a depressing kind of way. Noticed a guy on my team straight destroying people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map. Not saying such a thing is impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distances is not something a person can pull off constantly without cheating. But not to worry the other team had their own hacker(s) as well so I guess the equation balanced itself out in a kind of psychotic way. Shame on me for not noticing this sooner. I get rushed by a guy with a shotgun and realize that NOT ONCE during the entire match has he reloaded or ran out of ammo as he is rampaging around the map which is rather suspect if you ask me. This game basically took all the elements people enjoy in shooter games and combined them together but their execution in designing around these concepts was done in a very mediocre manner. The problem with the designers is that they don't have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular elements in the gameplay. I can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you're feeling brave enough to play for yourself (Who knows you miles may vary)",0,anger
853,WARMODE,2015,"Early Access ReviewI really think this game is a lot of fun and that is has potential. I'm really surprised that this game has made it this far into development. Though there are bugs in the game, there are very minimal and are extremely rare to come across. When I started playing the early build of this game, I started to encounter hackers in the game, but as the game progresses in development, I started to see less and less. This shows me how much time and effort is being put into the game to make it enjoyable for everyone. I approve this game and can't wait for it to become out of its beta stage and be set to go into the actual steam store page listed not as an early access beta, but as an actual free-to-play game.",1,enthusiasm

862,WARMODE,2018,"Early Access ReviewRussian attempt at making basic counter strike clone. It is a bit unusual since it isnt p2w, but it misses core mechanics and anticheat. Menu is basically just a server list and a shop with real cash only skins. These have weird level requirement, but its easy to reach it. Skins go from 50 cents up to 3.5 dollars for the highest level skins. Skins look kind of decent even if they are same pattern reused a lot of times. Sadly they aren't in the steam inventory which makes them pretty much worthless, unless you really want to spend money on this game. There are also some hats and banners, which require payment as well.Game offers 4 different game modes: ""Deathmatch"" (team deathmatch), Confrontation, Sabotage (search and destroy/plant the bomb) and Zombiemode (pvp). I mostly found players playing deathmatch, there is very little of them left though.Now the interesting part, especially for a free to play game is that all the guns are bought and reset during the match. There is no inventory where you manage the guns in the lobby, annoying trial guns, p2w weapons or lucky boxes; instead you enter the match and gain 2000 points (depending on game mode) which you can use to buy some guns for start. The more kills you get, more money you gain progressively during the match which you can use to buy new weapons. These points of course reset for every match, so everyone gets a fair start.Gunplay felt lacking for me, the gunsounds were extremely bad, everyone was running around with knife trying to get some easy kills, since all it takes is one knife slice to get a kill. Running is just way too fast for game to be an enjoyable shooter. Most of guns have pretty horrible spread especially when moving, so you are forced to use ironsights which mostly block off your screen making it even harder to hit a target. Or you could try standing still trying to aim with crosshair while others are running to knife you and cheaters are noscope jumpshooting you.Warmode could've been at least a bit better casual shooter if it had any kind of anticheat and if devs didnt completely abandon it. Its only feature is that it isnt p2w, but thats about it. It held me for few minutes just so i could try out all the weapons.Pros:- Not pay to win- Weapons are bought with currency earned during match (works something like counter strike)- 4 game modes- Relatively decent looking cheap skins, available for direct purchaseCons:- No anticheat, cheater infested- Abandoned by developers- Small playerbase- Bad gunplay- Bad gun sounds- Small map pool- Running speed is too fast",0,anger
863,WARMODE,2016,"Early Access ReviewI know I dont have much time played but come on what else is there to do then shoot people. with that said I honestly had fun playing this game. It is very broken in alot of aspects but its early access which HOPEFULLY means its being worked on, right?. I get so used to hearing ""early access"" that it pisses me off. Early access IS for games that are being actively developed and for some players to get a tase of the action before the full game releases and at the same time the players help the devs by finding glitches, bugs, exploits etc. for the devs to correct. Early access IS NOT an excuse for a broken game.....

But give it a try if you in to space, battle ship fighting etc.",1,boredom
886,Fractured Space,2016,Early Access ReviewThis game has exceeded my expectation for an early access game. The graphics looks great and the gameplay is very decent.  The only annoying part of the game for me was being made to complete a 15minutes tutorial even though the UI is quite self explanatory. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.,1,surprise
887,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewALPHA REVIEW:First off, if you're thinking of getting this game, please understand that it is, at its core, a MOBA. (Think LoL in space.) It is however, a very unique MOBA; it is very different from say, LoL or DOTA, and it's not just because it's in space. Right now, there are not very many ships to choose from, but this is likely to change as the game develops. ""Creeps"" or ""minions"" are replaced by stations that have to be captured and ""towers"" are replaced by simple damage taken when you're in range of the enemy base. Upgrades, as of now, consist only of gathering resources from captured stations and gaining a universal upgrade every level gained. This will probably be changed to specific upgrades later. The middle fuel station buff is extremely helpful, so get that when you can. Warping in a fight is dangerous as it leaves you extremely vulnurable to damage. Choose the right time to warp. Teamwork is essential to victory, and this is tied to having a team with balanced ship types. A well coordinated attack can completely turn the tide of a game and to that end, use the warp paths wisely. Controls may seem sluggish or sticky, but this is mostly due to ship stats. This brings up the important point, know your ship! The strengths and weaknesses of each ship are made very clear after a few games. Knowing the capabilities of each ship during a fight can make the difference between wiping the enemy team and a 60 second respawn. The game asks a lot from your computer on the performance end. Lag is also a pretty big problem right now. Connecting to the servers is always a gamble and crashes happen quite frequently. These things are likely to be fixed in timeThe game is still in alpha, so don't expect this to be anything close to the final product. A lot of what I consider cons will likely change later on.TL;DR Pros-ConsPros:+Solid gameplay+Clear strengths and weaknesses between ships and loadouts+Teamwork a must+Great, detailed ship graphics(Alpha)+/- No way to cancel warp jumps (Alpha?)Cons:-High computer performance demand-Crashes 1/5 times (Alpha)-Few ship choices (Alpha)-Disconnect/can't connect to server 1/5 times (Alpha)",1,anger
888,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewBig ships in space? Who wouldn't want to dance the slow and deadly dance of cap.ship slugging it out at each other. FS looks good and I didn't run into any bugs first time running it. Lacking any kind of tutorial the learning curve can be a bit harsh, but once you realize how things works it's a big fun. Team work a must in this one. Grab a copy and jump in, just remember that big ships are slow ;)",1,fun
889,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis is a MOBA game with big spaceships and even bigger potential.Whether the developers will achieve that potential is another matter, but they're definitely on the right track. If the premise sounds appealing to you, you will enjoy the game and it is worth the price of admission. It's very well done.However, it is early access, and as such, there are a lot of missing functions, some balance issues, bugs, and a lack of content which appears to be in the process of being addressed. My biggest concern at the moment, in terms of ""I want to have fun right now,"" is the lack of tooltip details.Let me explain. You get choices on which weapons/abilities to load your ship with. However, there is absolutely zero description of what any of the weapons do aside from the name. So you kind of have to try them all and figure out how they're supposed to work.  Yes, this will obviously be addressed, but in the game's current state, there's sort of an unnecessarily high learning curve.Still, once I figured things out, I started having a ton of fun, and I'm glad I paid the $10. I'm having fun finding new ways to sneak up on enemies and blow them to pieces.",1,happiness
890,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewVery good game, i lloved SWTORS new space combat system but i was found it stupid just fot that subscribe every mounth, i was looking for a game to replace and finally i found it, the game is new and in early acces, and for this the game is IMBA, but its need worked on it i hope it will not stay like this. Ps: my english sucks i now.",1,happiness
891,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewFractured Space is exaclty what it says in its description. You are in charge of a large spaceship where you have to decide where to postition yourself and when you fire to get the most out of your weapons/abilities. Inevitably this is going to be compared to star trek, battlestar galactica, dreadnought, star conflict but i believe that this game can take elements from these games/shows to make a unique game with a solid free to play system.Still in early access so keep in mind some things may change.Their are a total of 12 ships which have varying unique properties. Graphics, effects and models are fantastic with improvements to quality and performance every major update. Having more local servers would be nice (to reduce ping) but its quite easy to find a game. With each update the game gets better and better.Overall a great game, essentialy a moba in space with large spaceships with flashy battles. Love to see how this develops. The price for the forerunner and harbinger are woth playing the game but keep in mind that this is going to be free to play in the future.EDIT: updated with more current info",1,enthusiasm
892,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewVery enjoyable game if you enjoy team based objective games. Ships are all fairly interesting and each has it's own unique feel. So far, things seem fairly balanced, every ship has some type of counter ship, and each ship fills a particular role in combat. I would definitely recomend picking it up and giving it a try. Takes a few games to really figure things out, but once you do, it is enjoyable.",1,happiness
893,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewThe Takeaway: Fractured Space has qutie a  lot of good potential. The graphics are great thanks to the UT4 engine. The gameplay is something fairly new and fresh despite being based on existing MOBA archetypes.  I felt that there's enough promise to put my $15 USD on the table after playing just a few matches. It's like Homeworld, World of Tanks, and LoL/DOTA/HoTS had a giant party and everyone got together at the end of the night and this sexy minx is the result.The Good:  Amazing graphics for a MOBA title Fresh gameplay for the genre Intuitive, easy to master controls Unique ship designs that feel plausible as real starships (some folks don't care, but for me that's a HUGE thing) The Bad:  HORRIBLE lag issues. (I'm used to SOME lag, but I've had a few matches where I would jump large distances from where I was or where I intended to be without using any speed enhancing abilites. No tutorial, and for a game as complex as this one can be, at times. There needs to be a bit more information about exactly how matches are supposed to work included as perhaps non-intrusive in-game tutorial messages (Move next to the point to capture and so on. Something simple that you can breifly read on screen before it gently fades out). I've managed to work out so far you shoot other ships and capture points on the map, but exactly how to do so in order to achieve victory isn't readily apparent even after reading the in-game ""How to Play"" primer which barely had enough explanation to fit on an MTG card. There's nothing the actually explains how ship or tech tree progression works either and if you didn't know you could upgrate your ship's systems you'll be less effective as you grind up to the next tier of ship. HOWEVER THERE IS ONE BIG CAVEAT I'LL GIVE TO MY LITTLE BIT OF WHINING ABOVE. I DIDN'T BOTHER TO READ ANY OF THE ""HOW TO PLAY"" STUFF OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL SCHEME FOR MY FIRST 3 MATCHES.

897,Fractured Space,2016,"Created 09.25.16Fractured Space is a game about driving your gigantic Spaceship into epic 5v5 team Battles on vast maps, with Sectors of up to 100 Kilometers Length. There are currently 33 Ships available to play. Where they are split into 3 Manufacturers, wich each boast their own distinctive Artstyle and unique Systems.Games can be played in the two currently available Gamemodes ""Conquest"" and ""Frontline"", where the first feels somewhat like a good old MOBA and the latter like a fast King of the Hill match with base-Capture elements.Ships can manouver almost completely free, though you are unable to roll and only limited tilting is possible. Though this goes to ensure that certain ships can function the way they were designed and combat gets more challenging. More on that later.Movement between sectors is achieved via a ""Phase-Relocation"", also called Jump, wich keeps both your orientation and momentum.Fractured Space features a very high depth of mechanics, wich might not jump your thought immediatly and will require some getting used to. Such as the concept of Armor and breaking Armor causing you to take increased Damage from enemy fire.Fractured Space, due to its high depth, delivers lots of potential for very tactical play and thus has huge potential to become an E-Sport in the future.Here are my, personal, Scores for the Game:Graphics: 9/10  The Unreal Engine delivers again! And so do the Art-Devs from Edgecase games! Beatifull looks!Sound: Solid 8/10 Despite the usual ""No Sound in Space"" thing, Fractured Space features a really immersive Soundscape!Depth: 9/10 In terms of Depth, Fractured Space beats most MMOSA's ive yet seen. May be a bit to much for the casual Player.Character Design: 9/10 The Ships you play feel very very Unique, and become so even more with Loadouts and Crew.Gameplay: 7/10 Gameplay is a bit unintuitive at times, but a well done Tutorial helps with the tremedous depth of the Game.Now, do I recommend Fractured Space?HELL YEAH!Its one of the most revolutionary Space-Shooters ive ever seen and the Unreal Engine makes it just SO nice to play and look good. The Game is fair and balanced. No cheaters to bee seen since the game started. There is payed content to the game, but this completely restricts itself to Skins, giving you the cool looks but nothing else. While you can also buy ""Credit Boosters"" to simply get your next ship faster.That being said, a more expensive ship doesnt mean you will have an easier time. Having a newer, more expensive ship gives you absolutely no advantages over other people.Now there are some players i defenitly don't recomment to touch Fractured Space, because the game takes quite some effort to be successful in. So just quickly Jumping in for the pure Ownage will likely not work out.",1,happiness

904,Fractured Space,2017,"Superb spacecraft design - these are the most solid, realistic, detailed capital ships I've seen in any game so far and better than most AAA movies and TV shows. I'll say it again - the ships are original, believeable and simply gorgeous.Gameplay is fairly basic, and any time you're not in combat, you will be made acutely aware that you're playing a freemium game; the ads, offers and unlockables take up a fair amount of screen real estate between matches.Battle location choices are still a little limited (at the time of writing)But there's at least 15 hours of satisfying multiplayer here, if you can get servers full of real humans....and damn, son.  Lemme tell ya - Those ships?  So pretty.  drooooooooool.",1,happiness
905,Fractured Space,2016,"There's not a lot of Space games on the market that many can get behind. Somewhere down the line, devs effectively equated space with complexity, so for years we were driven away with spreadsheets, graphs, and pure busywork. However the genre continues to be an itch I can rarely scratch with the rare exception (Rebel Galaxy being one).This is another. As the synopsis demonstrates, this is a creep-less MOBA. It has much of the staples. Zone control for resources, except those 'resources' mostly translate to 'team experience'. You zone back to a base in order to 'level up', comparable to how you buy items in DoTa or LoL. After that, it's just a 5v5 beat'em up with a fair bit of strategy and adjustment. Like many space games, you have to think on the fly and move your ship behind the dozens of asteroids that litter the zones in order to mitigate the damage you'd otherwise receive. Like with many team-based games, it's more fun when you play with friends. When pugging, I lost against AI because everyone pulled a Lone Wolf mentality that just does not work here. A lesser ship cannot take a greater one without sniper support. A tank ship cannot 1v2 unless he has a support ship on his back. One match had two snipers in it which meant they remained in the back (As they should) but it meant that we had a fraction of people that could not capture bases with us. The list goes on.There is also no pay to win here. At best, with real money you could buy crew members outright which give you an extra 10% utility here, some 4% damage there, and only serves for diehard minmaxers but the basic set of crew is all one really needs. The real game here is to pick a few of your favorite ships, adapt to their styles, and just win with superior skill, and it won't matter if an enemy does an extra 6% damage or not.Everything else is mostly cosmetic, with the obvious credit boosters and whatnot like every other F2P.One of the things I want to touch upon that has nothing to due with the game's playability or mechanics - But the ship designs are some of the best I've seen in a long time. Just opening the game's tutorial giving the overview of the Pioneer gave me some epic feelings. And then just looking at ships from the Hangar menu, you can tell a lot of love went into their designs. Every inch is covered. You can see storage bays, lights under metal panels, antennae. Kudos to the designers.I've met many like me, needing a space game without it feeling like a second job. This one fits the bill. Space MOBA. That's what it is.",1,happiness
906,Fractured Space,2014,Early Access ReviewFor one thing its good need's bug fixing bit more optimzations and the disconnecting part get's a bit annoying. Umm is just MP only are there is a single player also going to be included just to try out the ships.,1,anger

Thinking about later stages of development I must say this is a game with a lot of potential. If you love space battles and intense fighting give it a try. Its worth it.Only a few basic ship types available at the moment. But all have very differeent roles and give you very different possibilities to play against the enemy ships. You have cloaked Assassins, Disruptor ships that can heal your allies and disable the weapons of enemys. There are Sniper Ships, Huge Flagships etc.Highy recommended and fun game.",1,fun
910,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewFractured Space has a great deal of depth and tactical complexity. A new player can pick up the basic mouse-and-keyboard commands after a few matches and yet a 100+ hour veteran can still find new tricks and tactics.The recent change for ship acquisition makes the grind for new ships very manageable.  New players can quickly pick up a decent cross section of ships, while leaving a few more expenive (and newer) ships as goals to pursue.  The only purchaseable elements are purely cosmetic or means to bypass some of the unlock grind.  Despite some reviews here this game is absolutely NOT pay-to-win.The design team is very active in releasing new updates to the game.  While some bugs and significant ship balance issues remain, as is typical for an alpha-stage game, the updates have largely been incrementally improving the game for the past year-and-a-half.Key Features:-Deep tactially spaceship combat-Beautiful visuals (esp. for an alpha)-Manageable unlock rate-No PTW elements-Active development teamWeaknesses:-Some server lag and stability issues-Growing, but currently limited, player base-Ship balance still a work-in-progressVerdict: Try it today!

921,Fractured Space,2016,"Zum Release gibt es auch ein aktuelles Review.Fractured Space ist keine 0815-Kost. Der Anfang wirkt chaotisch und unfair. Das liegt mehr oder minder daran, dass die meisten Schiffe spezielle Rollen erfÃ¼llen. Fast noch spezieller als in jedem anderen MOBA. Beginnt man mit dem Spiel, denkt man anfangs von seiner BrÃ¼cke aus, spÃ¤ter fÃ¤ngt man (wenn man die anderen Schiffe kennenlernt) an im Teamrahmen zu denken. Dann wird es richtig interessant, aber streckenweise auch etwas frustrierend (wenn das eigene Teamplay nicht so wirklich funktionieren will). FÃ¼r Solospieler und lonely wolves ist das Spiel nicht geeignet. FÃ¼r Casualplayer die ihr eigenes KillbedÃ¼rfnis auch mal hinter Teaminteressen zurÃ¼ckstellen kÃ¶nnen schon eher.Spielst du mit Freunden? Umso besser! Da es noch keine Ingamevoice-MÃ¶glichkeit gibt, bleibt nur der 90iger-Jahre Chat. Das ist definitv nicht zeitgemÃ¤Ã, aber sofern ich die Devs richtig einschÃ¤tze - und ich habe das Spiel schon eine ganze Ecke - wird das auch noch kommen. Dann eben Curse, oder TS oder wie sie nicht alle heiÃen :)Fractured Space hat eine steile Lernkurve, sofern man denn will. Auch ist es eines von wenigen Spielen heutzutage, bei dem es Sinn macht Guides und Tipps von erfahrenen Spielern zu lesen. Es ist ein kleines Microuniversum. Genauso wie Schach. Nur eben bunter und bombastischer.Grafik wird durch die aktuelle Unreal Engine auf die Monitore gezaubert. Auch wenn ich kein Fan der UE4 mit ihrem fÃ¼rchterlichen AntiAliasing bin, so knallt und explodiert es Ã¼berall ziemlich farbenfroh. Da gibt es kaum etwas zu beanstanden.Der Sound ist ein eigenes Kaliber. Jede Waffe, jede FÃ¤higkeit, jede TÃ¤tigkeit hat ihren eigenen einzigartigen Sound und erhÃ¶ht deutlich die AthmospÃ¤hre. Es besteht fÃ¼r mich kein Zweifel, dass (wenn die Spieler so wollen) FS ein ordentliches Zeichen im E-Sport setzen kann.Thema Pay2Win:Sofern man EchtgeldkÃ¤ufe fÃ¼r Schiffe (die nicht besser oder schlechter sind als die Starterships), die man problemlos (4-6 Spiele fÃ¼r die ersten) auch fÃ¼r IngamewÃ¤hrung kaufen kann als p2w bezeichnen mÃ¶chte, dann ist es das. Einen Vorteil erhÃ¤lt man dadurch nicht. Fractured Space lebt vor allem von der richtigen EinschÃ¤tzung der Situation. Wer meint ein teures Schiff kaufen zu kÃ¶nnen und damit newbs wegzubocken, findet sich schneller auf dem Respawnscreen wieder als einem lieb sein mag.ES GIBT KEIN P2W in Fractured Space.TL:DRDownloaden und ein paar Tage spielen. Nicht von der steilen Lernkurve abschrecken lassen. Es lohnt sich! So etwas gibt es nÃ¤mlich nicht noch einmal.",1,fun
922,Fractured Space,2016,"Only had this game for two days, but really enjoying it.  The tutorial does a very good job of leading you through the controls and how to play the game, and the 3 'starter' ships you begin with are no less capable than any of the other ships, they just have roles which make them easier to play (detection capable scout used in tutorial, a fast attack ship, and a support ship with healing AoE pulse and ability to break enemy armour).  All the ships in game are able to be obtained without spending real money, and the rate at which you can earn them seems pretty quick - there are multiple ships at relatively low cost, across a range of roles including a very tanky battleship, a medic ship with healing beams, a cloaky ambusher, etc.  The ships for the more complex roles will take a bit of time to work towards, but thats probably a good thing as it means by the time you can buy one, you've probably worked out how it could be used.",1,happiness

926,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewA New Face for Early Access?When most people hear ""Early Access"" in a game's description, what do they think? ""Shoddy, unfinished, unpolished, cash-grab.""Fractured Space is an Early Access game, and without a doubt it blows those stereotypes out of the water (or would that be asteroid belt?)As an Early Access game, FS stands out with its beautifully polished content, but suffers from a lack thereof. What's in the game (as of the time of writing) is phenomenal, but one can't help shake the feeling that it's an empty frame - beautifully crafted - waiting for something to fill the void.However, do not take this as a negative. The relatively small amount of content that exists in the game is still enough to keep a player occupied! Upgrade costs are balanced in such a way that players can look forward to tweaking their loadout with a new gimmick after every match, or hold out for a few more and get an entirely new ship.With a pace that shifts from relaxed to blistering at a moment's notice, the game itself is stunning, breathtaking, and incredibly fun to play. There's something magical about drifting in calm silence to let your ship repair one moment, then warping in to a hurricane of shrapnel and broadside fire the next. Fractured Space truly captures the mix of nerve-wracking tactics and frenetic action that real space combat would be - and wraps it up in an intuitive, easy-to-learn package.The assets are absolutely gorgeous and the atmosphere is incredibly well thought-out. Ship design seems to take cues from modern popular Sci-Fi as well as the classic Hard Science Fiction of the 20th century. The first time I clapped eyes on the game's ""Flagship"" heavy cruiser, I felt the spirit of Robert A. Heinlein become one with my own and we both giggled uncontrollably for several minutes from sheer glee.Fans of War Thunder and other tactical vehicle-based team warfare games would be well-advised to pick this gem up ASAP. ",1,happiness
927,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewDo you like MOBA gameplay such as  DOTA 2, LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, HON and other similar games?But you also like BIGâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SPACESHIPS WITH BIGâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥GUNS SHOOTING FIERY BALLS OF DOOM AND LASORS AT OTHER SPACESHIP?THAN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU, WAIT NO LONGER AND INSTALL NOW!!Basicly you're going 5 vs 5 with a spaceship of your choice, capturing points  and eventually trying to capture the enemy base. The more points you capture the more resources you gain per second, and resources mean upgrades to your ships health and damage, giving you advantage over  the enemy ships. Currently you can choose between 15 or something ships (but this is still alpha, more ships to come for sure), you got  tanky ships, high damage ships, long range ships, close range attack ships, assasin ship (like you go in stealth mode, pop up next to enemy ship, do a lot of damage and then get the hell out of there), support ships (repair yourself and allies, or increase damage done on enemy ships for you and your allies.) and some mixed ships that have a little of everything.I can only say that i've liked this game so far, there are some downsides like laggy servers ( like 1 in 5 games for me are laggy, and 1 in 15 or so is like almost unplayable due to lagg), but that is what you get when you play alpha release. other downside is that currently it is impossible to change the controls for the game (unless you alter some files) which is really anoying if you are one of the few people (belgium,france, ...) that use AZERTY keyboards, because the controls are for QWERTY which means you control the ships movement with ZQSD instead of WSAD. You can fix this by pressing alt+Lshift to switch your keyboard to qwerty mode, but than you will not be able to type properly.  All in all, great game, I am sure they will fix these problems in the near future, and when the game goes full release there will most likely be more ships and maps  and modes to play.I rate it  7.5/10",1,happiness

932,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewVery fresh approach to MOBA genre with popular cosmetic micro transactions system (absolutely no pay 2 win). Easy to get into, but hard to master. Also very competitive and visually stunning. Worth trying out. Big thumbs up!",1,happiness
933,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access Reviewlove the but the weekend deal is overloading their servers.  I will assume that will be fixed in time.  The way they use xp as a currancy prevents ""Pay to Win"".  Look forward to more in the future.",1,happiness
934,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewI picked up Fractured Space during the free weekend last week, and these are my thoughts after 3-4 days of playing it.Fractured Space is a very interesting and promising space combat game that combines A MOBA and World of Warships with a space age aesthetic. This game is relatively easy to get into, even for someone who generally dislikes MOBA's, such as I. The objective of each game is to capture the enemy base while vying for control of two lanes and a middle sector. You capture up to three mining stations to gain resources for your team. Resources are used to upgrade your ships, and the upgrade level of your fleet makes a huge difference in combating other players and capturing the enemy base. There is also the middle area, called the Gamma Sector. This is a large station that when captured by a team, gives the whole team a big damage buff, making pushes much easier to accomplish. Teamwork is a major part of this game, and this is made more obvious when you look at the variety of ships available. It almost reminds me of a class based shooter, like Team Fortress 2. You have your basic front line attack ships, the super massive defensive ships, and the support and healer ships. Any player can find a role and a ship that fits their play style the most. No ship is outright better then the other, which is a huge sigh of relief in a word of pay-2-win F2P games. Graphics are quite impressive in this game, though there are some minor rough spots here and there. The skyboxes are beautiful, distant planets look amazing, and the ships themselves are loaded with detail. The ships are the highlight of the audio-visual experience for me, looking like something a real company would make. They also sound great, weapons sound punchy and dangerous, and the warp drive really does sound how you'd imagine massive hyperspace engines would sound like. Though graphics can be a bit uneven in places, especially on asteroids. But as you're usually just flying by them, it won't bother you that much. There is also occasionally texture pop-in when warping into different lanes. But overall, graphics are sound are great.Gaining new ships and weapon in Fractured Space is a process of gaining experience in one of the three ship manufacturers in the game by using their ships, and making credits, which you gain after each round. It took me only a couple matches to unlock the first ship after the starter ship, and one more day to unlock the one after that. You can speed up the process by purchasing a microtransaction only currency and buying the ship with that, but you still need to unlock the ship with actual play time. And as no ship is a direct upgrade over the other, I find this very fair.Speaking of microtransactions, they are done very well in Fractured Space. The only exclusive things you can buy are ship skins and credit and XP boosters to use after the match, along with being able to purchase weapons and crew members (five stat boosters you can buy to improve your ship even more) faster. You can still buy these with credits, although it will take you longer. I think this system is totally fair and encourages people to invest in the game if they like it.My only real gripes with the game come from its Alpha, Early Access status. Matchmaking can sometimes not work, lag can playing borderline impossible, warping sometimes doesn't work, and general wonkiness and UI weirdness crops up. But all these things are being worked on by the devs, and the game isn't even in Beta yet. This game has a ton of potential, and I really hope that this game garners a large following in the very near future. Until then, I'll see you in the Gamma Sector while getting shot down by a Brawler.  ",1,happiness
935,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewWhile matchmaking is still being worked on, I can honestly say that the connection quality has shown some improvements, and I'm hopeful for the future. While it lacks the intense customization of games like DotA and LoL, it's current game format heavily resembles the balancing act that is involved with those games. Controlling stations gains you resources which level your team up, the more stations you control on the map, the faster you level, which in turn strengthens your teams ships. However, killing isn't the goal in this game, rather the capture of enemy forward bases to open the way for your team to capture their home base. Capturing stations will net you more resources, but also will signal to the enemy which sectors you're advancing on and where they should divert more ships to counter. There's a small series of tutorial missions that will enable you to get a sense of the basic mechanics of the game and how to move about, but it's up to you to get an idea of the tactics and strategy. There's currently three factions of ships, each with their own unique classes and abilities, so there's plenty of variety in the different ship classes, and there is also the chance to further tweak your ships through the uses of different crews and weapons. The game is slated to become Free-to-Play when it exits Early Access (may even be free now, not 100% sure) but, assuming there aren't any significant tweaks to the EXP and Credit rewards, the spectre of 'grind' doesn't seem to loom heavily as I've managed, as a rookie, to get around 1k of experience each game, making new ships availible every dozen games or so depending on my performance. Money will help unlock things faster, but the only things money can exclusively buy amount mostly to new skins for ships. It also helps that it scratches that capital ship itch. You know the one, the desire to maneuver a massive ship to bring an earth-shattering arsenal to bear on the enemy...",1,neutral
936,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewAbsolutely Great game with good graphics and fun combat... only downside (and what killed it for me) is that matchmaking is horrible, as I found myself grouped with teammates who didn't know what they should be doing, and enemy teams with 2000+ more matchmaking points than the team I was on, even being in a lobby with a friend (who is about the same level as me) did nothing to help.I'd love to see these things fixed, but untill they are, I sadly cant give this game more than a 6/10",1,neutral
937,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewWell everything already good about the game from landscape till the bases and the ships need to be more upgraded or should be more ship for every faction. The detail is so amazing but,should add more damage condition like engine problem or weapon jammed and that kind of poblem is needed on this kind of gameBut i still recomomend this game that love space adventure",1,happiness
938,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewFractured space has been a fun game, If you want a storyline Go to another game, This is a very good Strategy game and has had me playing for hours, The only thing that i would change is add a lore.

939,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewI will keep this sweet and short,  its a solid space moba light. with friends, its alot of fun, solo it can get frustrating at times but is still playable. the comunity is one of the least toxic and most helpful out their. and even if your playing at the highest level, there is alot of fun to be had.the only problem I have with this game is that they call it a alpha, in many ways its more pollished then any proper alpha I have ever seen,  being what it is however, its pretty good, but I want the devs to take even more pride in the work they did.the game is a bit fps intensive if you dont have good gpu (unreal engine) but is still playable for most ships.  there are a few which I do not recomend for beginner like the raven, raider, and ranger. but most of the other ships are playable if they have enough skill.lastly, devs are nice and funny.",1,fun
940,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewSo far my favorite game. Graphics are beautiful, controls are easy to use and unlike some people think it's not pay to win.

941,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis game is only in Alpha stages and I t hink it's beautiful :). Yes I only played for a few minutes but it was enough time for me to have a look at the graphics and play around with the ship, I thought the controls were nice and e asy to use, effects are cool :)I would recommend giving this game a go :)",1,happiness
942,Fractured Space,2016,"Im blown away by this game, the details of every ship is not something to be taken for granted, i usually have this sort of personal hate towards MOBA games because they usually turn out salty af, this game is not the case and i actually enjoy myself, its slow paced in a way but hey, those are huge ships.recommend it to anyone with a tactical view of playing games:)",1,happiness
943,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewI was going to breakdown everything in the game but wont bother and will keep it simple (although still longer than i expected):My opinion: Solid gameplay with no game breaking issues that ive come across yet. Only had some weird issues with the matchmaking but its not frequent enough to be too bad.  If played with an organized group, this game could excel even more, but still fun playing solo and most people do at this point. If you can get it free (weekend special as of posting) or on sale, and your remotely interested in this game, get it. The devs have shown they can develop it into a decent game.  The negatives are in the fact this game is still being developed, and needs some more variety in gameplay/maps. But really my negatives are limited to that and I do believe the devs have shown interest in properly developing this game and adding more additions.  I suppose a second lesser negative is directed towards Sci-fi junkies, if you observe the ships at face value they seem fine. But when you read the details they add things like the # of crew, which is cool, but its done very arbituarily. A lot of the ships looks like they are made of sheets of metal housing some bare bones weapon infrastructure inside. If anything they appear to be remotely controlled behemoths (and most actually appearing to be thinly defended by said sheets of metal), so I find it difficult to make out where exactly the crew on these ships live/move around/operate. Additionally, the physics of ship movement dont add up with what is graphically displayed. If i use thrusters to go upwards, and then stop using them, which passively levels my ship, what I see is the nose of the ship going up (with thrusters below the nose clearly pushing it, and the main thrusters at the back of the ship giving forward momentum), but then upon stopping my movement and evening back down there are no thrusters above the ship trying to even my ship out. This isnt correct as there is no gravity, and if my ship evens out thrusters at the top should be visibily attempting to level out my ship. Of course we can try and derail this critique by my use of leveling out, and upwards, and the fact its in space, but you know what i mean that has nothing to do with the graphics being incorrect.  Since scifi junkies are likely to be the ones most immersed in this kind of game, its important to have those aspects correct.Microtransactions: Limited to skins essentially, you CAN'T simply buy a ship to unlock and use it. There is a little more detail to provide in this regard but i wont bother, just know that microtransactions are heavily limited and you wont see people with more money winning. Every ship has its pros and cons too, so even if they could, not like that means they'd be the best.",1,neutral
944,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis is a great game, one of the bests I've ever played. It gathers the best of the MOBA universe (the importance of positioning, map awareness, knowing how to push and where jumping across sectors) and the intensity of games as World of Tanks or World of Warships. The ships are really well designed and the variety of playstyles feels very nice. I totally recommend this game.",1,happiness
945,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewNever played a space game quite like it, original concept MOBA/Space shooter. good graphics, runs well and has some variety and customisation. I'll be playing this one again for sure.",1,happiness
946,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewI played this game quite a while back for a bit, believed it to be decent, but lacking. I have to say the game has come quite some ways, but it is still in need of more quality of life improvements.The good:*Good preformance running 3770K and 980.*Not grindy no stepping up of this ship is better they are simply different.*Gameplay flow is good, slow enough to be tactical and fast enough to be fun.*Ships truly are different and forfil different roles within the game and just just this is a healbot ship and this one does damage. They all have their prefered way of playing so once you are in you will find the ships that suit your playstyle. The bad:*Pricing feels high on the micro transaction they are boarderline macro in my opinion and this is not a problem unique to this game. *Lacks a quick communicate option like a command tree where you can with 2-3 button presses ask for support, order an attack etc etc etc. Such a system would be helpful in public matches and specially give new players and idea of what to do. *Bit more feedback on what just nuked you would be nice, sometimes you can really go from being just fine to death in seconds a bit of a what happened would be ideaal to help you learn, again quality of life. The ugly: *Match making is unsure of itself it feels, 1 match is very quick and the next one just will not show up. This makes it quite annoying to play because there is also no indication of why things take longer. So if there are very few players communicate this, that way it is still bad, but not frustrating.Overal I would recommend this game to those who like big space ships and moba style games as that is what it is a moba with capital space ships.",1,happiness

It's a very strong game that has already enough content to hold on it's 10E pricetag, physics are really great, the engine choice is great, graphics are great, it runs smooth and it has bling-bling effects, and after all it's a medium scale space battle game, who doesn't love space battles?EDIT: I forgot to the add the fact that for some reason this game has like ~140 players online usually (which as I said is odd :( ) around all the time but the devs still develop it at a good rate.",1,happiness

954,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis game really is fun. Sure it is ruff around the edges but what EARLY ACCESS game isnt? They defintely need to add some more maps to pick from and of course more ships and gear is always awesome. Very simple you pick a ship get locked in with a team and fight to capture each others bases. Alot funner then you might think, so ya I recommend this game as it has HUGE growth potential. 2v2 player maps 3v3 player maps, different space areneas to fight in, weapons upgrades and whats with that first video? I would love to be able to go in my cockpit. The growth is there so keep it up guys. Also read alot of reviews about it not connecting to people? When I play I usually see 1k-2k playing and it links up most often in under 2min.

955,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewRelatively quick matchmaking, surprisingly intuitive gameplay, high skill ceiling, great aesthetics.

956,Fractured Space,2016,This game is a whole lot of fun. It's like World of Tanks meets a MOBA except space ships... CAPITAL space ships. There are many ship types and each is interesting and fun in its own way. Each match runs about 30 mins with a competant team. Game play heavily favors teamwork. I see myself spending a whole lot of time in this game.My only criticism: the ships handle like submarines.SUBS IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!,1,fun
957,Fractured Space,2016,"The game is not deep enough to endure the grindy progression to new ships, crew and equipment. Also the matches feel way to random with not knowing what the other team pick until your locked in your choice. The ships look good but the maps are quite bland and repetitive.

960,Fractured Space,2015,"Okay this is an edit to the original my opinion hasn't changed i still like the game. The Dev seems to be making improvements to the game things can go quickly or you have this nice drawn out space battle and just blow each other up which is what i like. Graphics are nice. I love the detail of the ships mostly it seems like they took there time in that aspect. Overall still and 8 out of 10. I hope to see more people join up for the battles.Ok, first I would like to say I have no idea how I got this game. It just was in my library decided to install and go from there. There is no tutorial but after a few matches you don't need one everything is kind of easy to learn. I honestly believe this game would be even more awesome if there was no pay wall. You can however earn things but simply playing the game it may take you longer but guess what if you got money get what you want. Overall I give the game an 8 out of 10 its fun, fast paced, sort of, and its in space.",1,happiness
961,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewI had this on my wishlist for a while and was afraid to pull the trigger because I kept reading that term MOBA.  I enjoy some MOBA type games like Awesomenauts.  I used to play LoL until it wasn't fun anymore because the community became toxic and it was hard to find games where people just played it to have fun.  Every match became way too intense with all the meta rules and immature people.  And I'm really happy to say that so far 'Fractured Space' has NOT been like that at all.  It's been a really enjoyable experience so far.  Game runs awesome, with zero problems on my rig.  (Intel i5 4670, 780 GTX SC, 8GB Ram).  The longest I've waited to get into a game is about 5 minutes.  People are either quiet or helpful, I'm sure they're â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s out there but I haven't run into them yet.  Games are strategic but very hectic and loose (your mom's hectic and loose) at the same time.The tutorials are short and not annoyingly overcomplex.  It's not pay2win, everything is earnable, save for a couple ships you can buy, but everything is balanced so no one ship is OP over another.I was worried I'd regret this purchase, that I'd go into games and think ""oh here we go again, some game junkie yelling at people for not following his grand plan and some meta"" because some of us don't have 100 hours / week to study every minute detail of a game.  Instead I've actually had fun playing this and when I'm not playing I'm actually anxious to play it again.",1,fun

WHO EVER READING THIS, BUY IT SO THERE WILL BE MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH/AGAINST!!! :D It has pretty simple controls and doesnt have that many buttons or things to consider, you can jump right in (after tutorial) and have some fun!If you are looking for a game that is more complicating (taking into account of many aspects within the game, like eve), then this might NOT be the game for you.Hope to see more from the developers :)",1,happiness
963,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewVery fun with a really involved dev team that releases regular news and updates.

966,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewFirst impression: awesome!Way to many asteroids that distract from combat. I prefer a few but dangerous asteroids instead (if impacted).Obviously this is alpha but we need more weapons and more counter measures. It would be wise to offer this for free as this is the win-win formula. Don't make it pay-to-win but instead offer all the ships freely but players can pay a few dollars for skins and other skins. You'll be CS:GO but in space.Also a little more fastpace (or offer faster and maneuvrable ships at the cost of fire power).Well done, keep at it, you are onto something here",1,happiness
967,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewPretty unique / solid game mechanics.  I agree with other reviewer's comment on this, its like a spaceship MOBA.  I particuarly enjoyed the art direction on the ships as well as the lumbering manueverability during gameplay.  It really gives you a sense of the massiveness of the boats.  Lastly, I hope they keep skins as the only thing that costs money to avoid PTW.  Also particularly interesting is how the ""classes"" are essentially divided based on ship size, manueverability, and specific CDs.  What sets this apart is the 3-dimensional aspect of each engagement.Given that its still in Alpha, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on the following.1) Optimization2) Lag spikes in game3) Connectivity issue into matches4) No complete texture on most stationary objects.What I'd like to see more of, personally, are as follows:1) Larger teams, 5v5 seems too small... 10v10 sounds awesome, with bigger maps.2) A slighter further zoom on the ship3) Better effects on CQC type weapons4) More game modes5) More non-interactive background battles in some of these maps for immersion.6) More customization on loadout (Think MechWarrior Online)7) A grander conflict to engage community to work towards something other than just a grind.8) It be awesome if EVE was like this =)Will buy again for sure.

968,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewGood game, can be a learning curve for new people to a spaceship idea, can be fun if you have a clue how to play, would recommend doing the tut (gives you a free ship)",1,happiness
969,Fractured Space,2016,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe first thing that struck me about this game is that it's beautiful: detailed capital ships glint from the light of alien suns, back lit from the blue glow of an earth like planet or the red fire of a lava world with undulating rolls of magma oozing below: it's stunning.   The game itself feels like naval capital ship brawling from the age of sail, only in three dimensions and with rail-guns, guided missiles and the cold vacuum of space instead of the sea with fishes in it.   Rather than the more abstract controls of most RTS games, this game puts you directly in control of a capital ship using WASD (plus extra keys for vertical) and the mouse for aiming. The ships feel suitably massive and take time to turn. This adds a tactical element, using asteroids for cover as you try to blind-side the enemy. I really like the three dimensional aspect of this: feels like I'm battling Khan, hiding in the nebula.  The ships feel imposing and as their arsenal rains down fiery death from all angles, it gives a satisfying feeling of might.  There's an extensive range of ships to choose from, each with their own playstyle. They all capture the feeling of being in charge of a large capital ship, rather than a zippy fighter. There is, however, some variation in speed and agility: you can expect larger ships to be slower but heavier armored and more nimble craft to be weaker. There are no fighter craft to control; some ships launch waves of fighters or bombers but you don't control these directly.    The specialised abilities of the various ships (stealth, recon, close combat etc.) in game require team based game play in order to succeed: the focus is on multi player with the only single player play available being the tutorial. Personally, I'd like to see either a story mode or more bot based play in order to further explore the game before facing down live players.  Fractured Space is a new take on a team based shooter: the slower pace and larger scale lends itself to a more strategic and thoughtful play style, like home world but with direct control over your units.",1,happiness
970,Fractured Space,2016,Early Access ReviewOverall one of my favorite free-to-play games. It's easy to really get into and you really have a ton of fun. Can't think of a better FTP on steam that I like better at the moment. Get this!,1,fun

978,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewFun game, lots of spaceships, from what I can tell the premium ships they offer are not overpowered in any way over their existing free to unlock versions and all you get is a money + XP boost from owning it and using it in a game. The rest of the ships seem diverse and the game has a captain you get for your ship that is a talking cat named Jonesy which is a Alien movie reference in case anyone missed that. That being said, the game is still alpha, but is coming along and is playable. At the time of this review, the crew part of the menu is kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥ed for me and my FPS takes a nose dive for no clear reason when I view the crew members in that menu and the only thing I can think of is because it is an alpha and they have not sorted out the bugs on it and probably not good optimization there yet.""We are vunerable from down below, and that is never a good thing to say!"" -Elax Zenchas",1,fun

There should be a way to have a matchmaker create games based on your ship and not you choosing what game to joinPlease note that i did get the game while it was during the Free weekend where if you downloaded it then you got to keep that copyI persionally am neutral about this game (meaning i dont hate and i dont love the game)This is my review of Fractured Space-Nuclear Poptart",1,neutral
983,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewThe game is great but I'd like to tell you my opinion then give you a overall summary:- some of the ships look like they are covered in foil and are all glittery which is kinda wierd- not much in the way of upgrades and it's impossible to customize the ships in any way.- the crew members sound..... wierd.- I thought I would be able to actually command a fleet of ships like at least 20 at the same time in a game but I can only use 1 and dont get me wrong, it's fun but it's just knda... underwhelmingOverall, I would give this game  a 6 out of 10 mainly because customization and upgrading aren't great at the moment and would like to see ALOT more variety. And if they could add some more ships that would be even better.",1,neutral
984,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewGood solid game at it's core, the Devs just need to fix the problems that have persisted for some time, such as ship tooltips not displaying correct information and the glaring issues with Crew creation (i.e. explain what the hell Crew skills do).  Not Pay2Win (yet) and it would be even better if they could get the ship mechanics right.  Matchmaking needs abit of work, half the time you'll find yourself as a novice playing with/against the top players on the leaderboards.  But the core gameplay is decent and enjoyable.  If you enjoy bashing your head on your keyboard after a match, or if you ever wanted to play World of Tanks but in LoL, this is the game for you.My one main issue: The Devs want $30 worth of Platinum to buy one Premium Ship that is exactly the same as the original ship, just reskinned with a pitiful (10%) exp/credit booster.  That's three times what the game cost at release. god damn ridiculous.  For $30 I expect a hell of a lot more than a new skin and dinky exp/cred boost.Spoiler!

987,Fractured Space,2016,"Hello friends! This game is one of my favorites. I've invested a ton of time into it and still play pretty much every night. Its a swirling melee of a game with plenty of depth to the combat with plenty of strategy and tactics to play with. So if you read no farther then know my opinion is: yes get it and start playing. This game is also 100% free to play! With absolutely no pay to win involved. Crew and ships as well as alternative load outs can all be purchased with in game earned credits (earned just by playing, which is why you are here right?) You can use money to speed things along, but mostly money gets you cosmetics. Some of which are really cool and lovingly made. And no ship is truely 'better' than all the others. The models and graphics in this game are georgous. It plays smoothly and is well optimized. It is still technically under development and so a lot of things have changed since i got here. But honestly it is amazingly polished. And at the time I am writing this things are in a great place. The balance is solid, with a few ships over preforming and a few under preforming. The thing that really sells this game for me isn't the team play (though I love that) or exciting combat but the unique way good piloting can turn a ship from average to unstoppable and how great tactics and strategy can make or break a team.

992,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewIs it fun? Yes.Is it worth money? Depends.The game is an early access version of what will eventually be a free to play game, with a tech tree similar to the likes of War Thunder or World of Tanks. However, it throws away the tiers, and instead balances all ships together into one matchmaking block, similar to Mechwarrior Online. It's enjoyable for a while, but the grind begins to get excessive. The good news is that you're not going to need to worry about repairs or ammo costs, which eliminates a point of stress in the grinding. The graphics are also absolutely beautiful. Unreal Engine 4 is put to the max, and boy does it look good. The ships also are interestingly designed.The game has two modes - a TDM style mode, and a capture the base mode. Both are enjoyable, but something like this could really use some more modes to keep its longevity. And now, onto the negatives. These modes won't keep your attention forever, and you'll quickly want more. The various classes of ships give a huge variety of playstyles, but again - you will be grinding a while to get a ship you may or may not like. UNLESS, of course, you decide to throw money at premium currency, in which case you can push to that ship faster, and this is a bit of a problem... unless you've snagged the game on a free-forever weekend, you've already tossed money at the game, and now they are asking for more money via microtransactions. This however, is only a temporary problem, since the game needn't be bought once it gets released.There also are major server issues, despite there only being a peak of about 1000 players online IN THE WORLD. Half the matches I'm in, I'll get severe lag stutters that are serverside, not on my end.Final thoughts - I'd suggest you DEFINITELY get the game on one if its free-forever weekends. It'll definitely net you enough enjoyment to be worth the download. If you want to get the game with money, I'd also say it's probably worth it, especially with the steam refunds should you not like it. Will it be worth the microtransactions? You decide.",1,neutral

994,Fractured Space,2018,"This is a great game honestly . Gameplay is amazing . Graphics are top of the line . Basically a Tower Defenese game in space. Make sure that you get Gamma when it goes Live and you win ... The thing that puzzles me about this game is the Community . Where is everyone at ? With as good and as much potentioal as this game has the player count is kinda low . Waiting to get into battles sometimes can take a few , but once you are in you are Golden",1,love
995,Fractured Space,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis game is already good in Alpha, can't wait to see what the 1.0 looks like.  TOTALLY worth the $10.00!!  The gameplay and rules are simple, but the tactics and strats can get very complex.",1,happiness
996,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewPersonally, I downloaded this a while ago. It was free weekend but unlike the usual situation with free weekend, I could keep this game FOREVER after downloading it. So of course, I downloaded and played it and to my surprise, it wasn't bad. Now, I haven't played this game for a while but I do have nice memories of playing with my buddies. A great team-based strategy game that allows the use of plenty of different tactics, whether you wanna soak up damage or sneak behind enemy lines and decimate the opposition, I'd recommend buying it.",1,surprise
997,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewThis game is honestly a one to get. Since it's in the Alpha stage of development, there are some bug and optimization issues that need to be fixed. There's great graphics, a really great community, and teamwork is a MUST if you want to win. Pros:+Good graphics+Non-Toxic Community+Teamwork is a must+Very promising for future releasesCons:-Limited Servers-Not alot of people-NEEDS MORE PEOPLE-A bit of a grind to aquire new shipsOverall, I give it a 9/10Its a fun game to play, stress the meaning of teawork since theres only 5 players to a team. Great game to play with friends and work as a team to win. There's advantages that working as a team can accomplish, like ambushing the enemy, distractions, etc. This game is very promising for the future, and I strongly recommend that people get the game.",1,happiness
998,Fractured Space,2018,"It was such a fun game early on. I had an issue when I paid for an alpha game and then it went F2P.  Didnt play for quite a while. I went back today and the player base is gone.  Sad because it looks like the new co-op missions look awesome but didnt have the patience to wait for a game that long.  Its free, so go ahead and try it.  Maybe certain days have more players.  It really was fun...  I had way more than 9.8 hours, that must be after launch.",1,fun
999,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewA great game, beautiful graphics. A little bit of a steep learning curve, and some bugs in the proving grounds missions. But it's still a great game. hope they will fix the proving grounds bugs, so I can play again. Until then no Fractured space for me.",1,happiness
1000,Fractured Space,2016,"Early Access ReviewReally cool game, especially as it's in an alpha state!+ Looks GORGEOUS, the ships remind me in style about Shattered Horizon [`]+ Fast-paced, focused gameplay+ Diverse ships and abilities, you can brawl on the frontline, debilitate your enemies or support your allies, it all depends on your ship choice- Not many players online. This game needs more promotion, and definitely more progress on the gameplay front",1,love
