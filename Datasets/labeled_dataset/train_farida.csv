252,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,"Very fun and actually terrifying game.  Got into it after watching Markiplier play it on You Tube.  My son and I love the premise and how campy the whole design of the game is.  However, the scares get serious and challenging real quick and you'll be jumping in your seat throughout the game, both from the cheap jumpscares and the terrible, terrible creatures that await you further into the mansion.  Not to mention all the land sharks.  This game should be a staple in every gamers collection.",1,hapiness
253,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewSo far, this has been an amazingly terrifying experience. I decided to take  break, due to the tension that's been growing in my chest. The tingling in my arm is getting hard to ignore. I would pay monies for it.But I didn't have to. (Thanks for that.)10/10.Seriously.",1,fear
254,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI really was not impressed with the controlls of the game..... The concept is awesome, and I love the ""cutesy"" style to it, but the controls are just a massive turn off for me...I really wish they would have a setting to turn down the sensitivty of the mouse or some type of option to enable WASD for walking and mouse just for viewing up/down/left/right.    A lot of potential though",1,fear
255,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter looking at the video I thought no way those paper cut outs will make me jump... I was wrongCan't complain about a free game, I played it and got free entertainment - definately worth a try.",1,happiness
256,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI have been watching a friend of mine play this absolutely adorable (and sometimes terrifying!) game for a couple of days now, and I have to say that I am supremely jealous I can't play it right now. The graphics are definitely akin to those you probably saw in your childhood days when playing Doom, but the floating ghost, Spooky, and the randomly cute jump-scare plywood cut outs are really what make this game. It's positively adorable, with a perfect amount of terror thrown in, and has me ITCHING for the day that my PC is replaced so that I can play it. I can't wait to see how this game developes.- Graecyn K | PCGamerGirl.COM ",1,happiness
257,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access Review*note* Pay no attention to the time as i got this game when it was on indieDB and got pretty far before letting it collect dust while pursuing other games (and the fact i got as far as worth proceeding in version 1.2). Now for the review.I'm not really a person who could judge what is considered ""cute"". i guess the cardboard cutouts are a bit amusing. that said those same cutouts are made me jump more than once when they appear after just barely escaping an enemy that doesn't need to follow the path to catch you. So in that regard i guess you could call them scary too. i also like that it seems that the devs stopped throwing a cutout at you every other room (like how they were in the indieDB version i played). But outside of those ""enemies"", the actual enemies are terrifying and will definitely get your heart racing. on top of that if it's your first time playing they can catch you off guard as there's no rhyme or reason for some of their appearances. What i mean is that unlike other horror games (good ones that is) there is a build up to an enemies appearance and on some occasions the ""rules"" to win against said enemies are laid out. take for example the first resident evil, the first zombie encounter is built up using sound effects to create an uneasy feeling of not knowing what's in the room with you. following up on that the rules for winning are laid out as if you try to fight the first zombie A) you'll notice you use up almost all your ammo and B) that you'll take damage whereas avoiding it you'll notice things like you are faster and more agile than the zombies (well agile while using tank controls) so evasion is a preferred option when you can.That's not to say that how the enemies appear in SPHJ is bad in fact the opposite. the fact you don't know when you'll encounter a type of enemy or how to beat it without trying a few times against a new enemy adds it's own eeriness as you don't know what the next room holds for you. You have to constantly think on the fly and adapt even quicker.However this brings up an issue i have with the game, there's way too much luck involved. i'll give a good example, the first enemy you meet is pretty easy to figure out, just run. but that strategy will bite you in the rear when you come to the first ""catwalk"" room (that's what i call it at least, the room with the narrow walkways that split in multiple directions). If you just dead sprint you have a 50/50 chance of taking the wrong path and getting cornered and that enemy takes you out in 3 hits.There are other points like this as there's an enemy i saw in markipliers playthrough i've yet to encounter that seems to appear at random with no way to figure out what you did wrong (or right in my case as, again, i haven't encountered the red face enemy in any of my playthroughs). so like i said, this game takes alot of luck if you're going to get far (or just alot of patience till you get that lucky run).the other issue i have i'm not sure if it's an aesthetic choice to encourage players to keep calm or if it's just how the game happened to be made. the issue is that you have to press forward every time you enter a room. what i mean is that you can't just hold down the W key and keep moving as soon as you enter the next room. No, in each room you have to release the key and press it again to move. this is really annoying against the aforementioned first enemy as if you forget this you won't move (and take damage) till you remember to release the forward key and press it again. Like i said i'm not sure if it's intentional or not, if it's not then i hope the devs will work on this as it's basically a cheap beginner's trap. But other than those two issues i do really think this is a good horror game and can't wait to see what the full release is like.",1,fun
258,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI want to preface my review by stating that I find this game to be fun even with the minimalist aspects of walking from one room or passage to another. The intrigue of what will be in the next room entertains me and leaves me with a sense of wonder. I keep feeling a voice in my head say, ""Just one more room..."" and so on as my character explores the mansion.I love the art design, and the cell-shaded look to it along with the cute ""cutouts"" that pop up in tight spaces here and there look very well done. I will have to say this though, there was a constant popping in the audio feed which made it a bit annoying to continue further in the game and it also took me at least ten tries before I could get past the warning screen and move ahead in the game without it crashing on me. I actually thought I was doing well, making it to the 75th room when I stopped to play a mockup of House of the Dead, and the game crashed on me yet again.I hope that they fix that bug as well as the audio bug that is still haunting this game because I think it has a lot of potential; I for one have to say how terrified I was of what happened in room 60 and beyond.For now, this game gets a 6/10. Pros:~ Great Art Design that looks great and brings me back to 1995 and Doom related games.~ While there are a lot of rooms that seem the same, there are subtle nuances that make them a bit different each time.~ The Jump scare moments, especially with the cute cut-outs actually got me. Kudos.~ Easy to get hooked.Cons:~ Audio bug that sounded like a bowl of Rice Krispies in my ears.~ Game is prone to crashing on the warning screen especially but anytime after that as well.~ No options section in the main menu except to teleport to different sections of the game (Room 50, 100, 150, etc.)",1,love
259,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat game, the horror aspects are great, also like the Kuybei reference. Can you have it where you can use a controller, and the steam overlay while in the game. That would make it much better:) Cheers Michael",1,happiness

261,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a really awesome game, it gives me that same vibe I get from playing LSD Dream Emulator where sometimes you're stopping to smell the roses, and then suddenly the roses are tearing off your face. There's tons of content here already and it's only yet in early access! I played for 20 minutes and found 2 minigames (wtih space for what looks like more), a bunch of notes that added atmosphere and a little story, and of course that first time the game actually became a struggle to survive, my friend nearby who was watching said ""This game just turned up the intensity by a ton!""Very cute style disguises what is actually a very thrilling experience, and I can't wait to see how much more is added to this over time.",1,fun

263,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI went into this game expecting typical pewdiebait like many free games on the marketplace. I think that's what they were going for, honestly, but I think they may very well have something good here. The game was incredibly well placed, allowing you to get comfortable before adding an element that will jar you out of the false comfort zone it creates. A few complaints, but otherwise really great.Pros:-Great Pacing-Wonderfully offputting environments-Some great monstersCons:-That ♥♥♥♥ING puppet-Spooky was abysmally written. Biggest flaw of the game. While everything else around you develops, spooky is the same till the end. Game would be exponentially better with some Spooky development-♥♥♥♥ that puppet-The better monsters were sorely underused. The Mummy was great, but the Deerhead guy could have seen some more spotlight-Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ that puppet. Sooooo ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. ",1,fun
264,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game i only played it for 1 hour reached room 300 died once this game just gave me few heart attacks the most scary creepy thing in this game is the sounds you dont know when a cute lil thing come out of the wall just to scare you will keep cursing all the way to the end , there is some monsters and some rooms will just let u quit (for weak hearts dont play this game if you cant handle the jumpscares) Nice Graphic ha ha but really Nice Game .I do recommend this game to who ever love to take challenges , have patience , strong heart , open mind  and love the Loud creepy sounds :)",1,fear
265,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewSo I'm playing this game thinking ""Oh I've been pretty well at horror games in the past. This shouldn't be too hard."" WRONG. HOLY CRAP IS THIS GAME WELL MADE. Okay, so it rips off some other horror games, but it uses them all pretty well. When you get to a new checkpoint, and move to a new area, the door animation looks directly ripped from the first Resident Evil. That alone sent chills down my spine. And the fact that no two games are the same makes for an interesting playthrough. What might have been the way to get out of a room once might change completly the next time you find that room. Oh, and you will also find the same rooms all the time. The only differences are that some monster/ghost is in the next room. With the hidden layers of story like FNAF, the gameplay of Amnesia (wandering around aimlessly), and the erieness of Slender, this game is fantastic.",1,fun
266,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewGot to the room 760 which is now the ending, because of the fact that work is not finished but.. for real, this game is amazing, I thought it's gonna be a boring one, but.. escaping from all those specimens, monsters! <3 I love this and I'm sure I'll buy DLC soon.

268,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is basically FNAF's formula of taking something simple and throwing enough mystery at it to keep you interested. It's way less original than FNAF somehow though..You get ""randomly"" generated rooms in a maze like house that is full of jump-scares, monsters and references. It's a very simplistic idea but it's also done very well. Even the jump-scares are done right, showing that timing and sound is what matters.There is a story and it's rather cute. Cute enough to be out of place, and that's why it's good. Everything feels out of place just to screw with you. It's not a pretty game with high quality gore and HD blood. It's a simple game that throws you into the unknown and cute world of ""something is off but I can't put my finger on it"".The only issue that I had with it is the framerate. While it stays at 60 constantly, it somehow feels like it drops regularly. Maybe this was intentional but I don't know...",1,happiness
269,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Early Access Reviewthis game is just AWESOME... i don't know what it is about it... when you go in you see the cutesy side of it and you think no biggie... but it is a very eerie and creepy game... i love this... totally recommended,1,love
270,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI did not think i was going to like this game. I would reccomend this game. Very Spooky. But god damn those ♥♥♥♥ing chase parts get me. Jumpscares. Eh Not so much. but the ♥♥♥♥ing chases. Those suck. It goes on through like 30 rooms and then, of course. They are all ghosts.

272,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewOverall, the game has a lot of unused potential. Its fun for a while, going through the randomly generated rooms. However, there is just too much laid back time. I find myself running through the rooms, just trying to make it to the next save point.  It would be nice if the monsters within the house appeared even just a little bit more often, or if the room designs varied much more. It was bland seeing the same rooms over and over again.The chases are nice. The music goes along well with the chases, as well, creating a good environment for when your running away from death. The designs of the things you see inside are very interesting and creepy indeed.All it really needs is more variety and less time spent walking through a load of empty rooms. I do, however, recommend a playthrough of it. It is free, after all.",1,boredom
273,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewJust a couple cute faces popping out, no biggie, thats where i was wrong.died floor 61, rip mespooky's house of jump scares.... it certainly lives up to its name o.othis is one of the creepiest games ive played!only 1 problem.... @""Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?“No, the base game is free during Early Access and will stay free after full release. The only items we are charging for are DLC and the game's soundtrack.”^ if they are only selling that i believe they will struggle making money, maybe add more floors that you have to pay for or something like that? i dont know",1,fun
274,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI love this game and I can not wait for the full version to be released (whenever that is) its the type of game that does everything right when you are playing using our knowlage as gamer's against us to try and mess with our heads at some of the later points of the games and actually informs you on some of the creatures only through little notes that are scattered through-out the randomly generated map, if you havent tried this game yet I highly recomend it",1,fun
275,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is one of the scariest, eeriest, most bone-chilling freeware games out there. Don't let the pricetag fool you, you get more than a bang for your buck. In my opinion this gamne is up there with SCP Containment Breach and Cry of fear",1,fear
276,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThe things I dislike about Early Access title, is that indie developers never fulfilled their promises.  I know there's a lot of them that are still not complete to this day.  So hopefully this interesting horror game can final nail it.  Spooky's House of Jump Scares is very similar to one series that is part of the Creepypasta Universe: SCP Foundation.  Also know as Secure Contain Protect.  This game has the similar premises of the SCP Foundation, and its a decent one at best.  These specimen you encounter adds nice tension throughout each same rooms that you enter over and over again, even the game mentions about it, if you read the notes that is to get you more invested to the game lore.  The game sadly doesn't learn a thing or two from Bloodborne and Alien Isolation, which those game refines the horror genre completely.  Yes I am aware this came out at January before Bloodborne got released.  I would have expected the game break free from the cliches that horror games have been stuck with in the past.  I'm looking at you both Slender and Amnesia!The gameplay is all about running away from the Specimen and go to one room to the next.  You have a health bar and stamina system that it seems its trying to play like Dark Souls a bit in First-Person, the game has no boss battles at all, so the challenges is to run away and dig yourself into the game lore.  You take damage if your too close to the Specimens, however you can get instant killed by one of them if your not very careful in one room.  You do get an axe very late in the game but combat feels sloppy at times, maybe it'll be better integrated at full release?  Sadly the game is not complete right now.  There's still a few rooms to go in order to see more Specimen and finally know the truth behind this curses house and the company behind it.The optimization is bad, there's no way to change the resolution, or the game doesn't have settings to make the game perform better.  You can change the framerate but that about it.  Hopefully, the creator will make the game run a lot better than the state its currently in right now!  Visually its not a bad looking game, the Specimen looks nice, they have quite disturbing powers to mess with you, and the sound effects are average at best.  Not much to say about the score, its ok for now.  Maybe the final build will have a good credit theme when you reach the one room to get the answers we all want.  Who knows when this will be finished.  So I'm recommending this.  Because its free, and well despite its disappointing shortcomings the game has potential to be something worth playing from beginning to end.  Why not let your friends play it, or better let some young child play it and he or she will know what its like getting their guts spooked!  Hee hee hee...",1,fun
277,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI will say only this.......this game gave me cold chills...and I only played 4o minutes and came to room 100...my God this is gonna be a coooold bloody game.....10/10 would try...but you need to try this its scary,funny,and..well lets hope I have enough towels to whipe my forehead XD",1,fear

From the humble beginnings of kawaii cardboard cutouts (the first 2 or three will make you jump), the game slowly but surely builds into a more menacing beast, with a host of different creatures that include some great throwbacks to other great creepypastas/horror games. The games controls are simple, with you bieng able to move around Fps stylie and interact with objects such as keys and doors (and I think theres an axe later on) as well as some hilariously misgiving minigames that pretty much give you a summary of the game as a whole in the sense that they go from innocent to ultraviolent in mere miliseconds...Overall, for the deceptively cute art style, deceptively likeable main character, deceptively lively mu- no actually, the music doesn't lie to you at all, I would really recommend giving this game a shot.

Forgive my profane remarks, but I was under the impression that this would be a joke game, kind of silly. But I was wrong, oh was I so so dearly wrong. The first few jumpscares are cardboard cutouts that are so cute, they're terrifying. The sudden nature of their breaking out destroyed me. There are little boss monsters, but nothing too major. At least until that... little girl. Ugh. The main horrors are based off of a myriad of different horror games. There is a slime monster, that I just equate to Slimer from Ghostbusters. There is a spider that is from Resident Evil. There is a little ghost girl whom I can only assume is from F.E.A.R. And then the return of death incarnate for me. Silent Hill references.

I'm not usually a fan of horror games, but this one really pulled me in with its self parody and clever references. The game starts out very cute and innocent, the first ""enemies"" in the game are cardboard cutouts of skeletons and slimes that pop out from the wall.

297,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI remember playing this a few months ago, after I found it on Desura while searching for a good scare. Came across it, looked cute and didn't think it would be that scary, I actually downloaded it to troll. So I play, lovin' the graphic style, then things start popping out and I start getting terrified to the point I'd rather just play Amnesia.Since then, this game has muc bigger rooms, more objects, a weapon, many more sounds for the scares, windows, etc. I actually played it a bit too much to where it didn't really scare me but after this it got me because of these new sounds. There are also dark rooms in which a flashlight is needed, and the HUD has been improved. This game can really turn into something amazing. What I disliked is the stupid intro.. It was meant to be funny, I'm sure, but it annoyed me, it's my opinion so..The downfalls; The options menu is terrible in my opinion, I sat in my chair pressing enter about 20 times trying to turn Invert Mouse on, but had to position it perfectly under the line, it's a horrible set up compared to how the rest of the game is. The game is also not complete, but this is a small issue as many people will probably quit and uninstall after a certain ""ghost"" starts following in room **. To those looking at the requirements, they are completely over the top.

It starts with a rather cute looking ghost 'spooky' telling you to traverse the rooms of the mansion, Along the way you'll see cute cardboard cutouts of octopi and ghosts. As you get further into the mansion you will meet other monsters that will chase in a less jump scary fashion such as a slime monster or a ghost girl.The only real downfalls this game has is that it is rather repetitive, as it is jump scares after a short while they lose their edge and scariness so you just end up speeding through each room and majority of the monsters are just slow chasers so you can just outrun them. It does have some different sections amidst the repetitive-ness such as a space-like section, a rusty school section, etc.It's mainly a shame that after room 760 there is nothing new (for now) as the developer has a message pop up stating that from then on it is incomplete.",1,fun
311,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game.... It's so charming and cute, atleast, for the first part of the game, it's a very satirical game, and it knows how to be satirical perfectly. And best of all it's absolutely FREEEEEE!!!!",1,happiness
312,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game does exactly what it intended and does it very well.It eases you into the fact that there will surely be some jump scares, and evolves into so much more the further you progress.The soundtrack is absolutely amazing at creating the atmosphere that the game needs, it wouldn't be possible to pull off what it does without the sounds and music.Very well made free game that is definitely worth the small size of installation.",1,happiness

It's a seemingly cute and cuddly parody of modern horror games, where you travel around a massive mansion full of terrifying monsters.

338,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"Product received for freeIt delivers upon what the name implies, and often that is all you should expect from a free game.That said, there are flaws that left me not to recommend it.-you can't use your mouse in the menu-there is no volume slider-the resolution can only be set to wrong and worse, and has no manual imput-clicking ""new game"" automatically overrides your previous save without a confirmation-mouse drag because the game has an fps cap (I'm assuming that's the reason, anyway)-you cannot pause the game or otherwise access the menu during a cutscene-you cannot move backwards in the menu by pressing Esc-alt-tabbing leaves the game's audio on-alt-tabbing while not having the game paused or in a menu traps your cursor in the center of your screen, which can only be resolved by opening your task manager and forcefully closing the application (without your mouse) or restarting your pc.The last being my main concern, honestly.It's a very minor issue if you know what's going on, but it's intrusive. And I could imagine it to be quite difficult to deal with if you're not the kind of person who uses the task manager frequently, or simply doesn't know how to use shortcuts. (except for alt-tab(though it could still be triggered by programs like skype))All in all, it feels like a mobile port, and a poor one at that.The pixelized stylization is alright, and overall the game is decent enough, but I can't be bothered to put up with such an absolute bottom-of-the-barrel UI.",0,hate

345,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,"Overall: Not very Interesting, repetitive.There are some levels that just skull♥♥♥♥ you for no reason, offering no skillful way to counter it other than hitting escape and exiting the game. Lacking save points make the player more on edge, but in turn make gameplay experience suffer because if one level is failed, you have to repeat countless levels with no rewards. Although I do enjoy the cartoon jump scares somewhat, it seems as if they are just thrown in to make a boring game less boring, but end up being a mere annoyance once the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses start showing up. Randomly generated levels with minecraft's ""10 blocks"" render distance setting on fails to even create the illusion of skillful navigation within long levels. The lack of variance in level design makes interest fade in the middle stages of the game. Minor issues such as having to re-press ""W"" every time a level loads in order to keep moving forward adds a unending inconvenience that makes repeating levels that much more boring to navigate. OP Enemies with minimal deterrent methods (The ""Ben Drowned"" Creepypasta enemy which you just have to keep looking at for the remainder of the level, which proves boring when you get slapped with a bunch of linear ""Maze Pit Levels"") remove any psychological deterioration elements from the game, as they just become a minor annoyance, *with exception of the monster that turns the graphics into bone-shilling youtube666-era designs*.  Sound design is good, as music is intentionally screeching in order to install anxiety within the player, but some cartoon jump scare sounds drag on and unneededly ruins the ""Spooky"" aesthetic. Good for the first while, but I don't think a lot of people could enjoyfully complete the full 1000 Levels. Not from being scared, but from boredom. ",0,boredom

Then, there come Spooky's ""specimens,"" which are startling and not cute, which the you might not expect. The game adds more depth with a few references and rooms with silly morbid mini-games, which emphasizes how much you should actually fear ""Spooky."" Spooky is a very adorable character, too. I love her design and how she too seems like a joke at first, but then you start to realize she's pretty evil and crazy.

The game even plays for you so you can accumulate gold even when you are not playing.I kept playing wondering if there was anything else to it, but there really isn't.

383,Sakura Clicker,2015.0," Note: This is going to be a 'serious' review Normally I like Sakura games. They're fun perverted visual novels with absolutely Ludacris plots, dialogue, and situations that scream fan service with copious amounts of anime boobs, butts, and the occasional tentacle monster or two. However Sakura Clicker is anything but that. Yes, it does have Anime girls(dressed as animals and Ancient Egyptian gods for some reason - so I guess if you get off to Anubis or Osiris this is the game for you) but that's really it. You click on those Animal/Egyptian god Anime girls to do damage while your character stands awkwardly to the right and watches you. Each Animal/Egyptian God Anime Girl you defeat drops gold which you can use to hire Hero's to help you or upgrade stats and that's basically it. All you end up doing is basically click as hard as you possibly can until your wrist feels like it's about to implode and ending up on the next monster. The game is a never-ending grind fest of just doing that over and over again while facing the same 5ish Animal/Egyptian God anime girls over and over again. So why this game was made you ask? ""Oh it can't be that bad, it's free right?” One answer: To sell DLC outfits to thirsty guys that makes your character that stands to the right be wearing a bra made out of a ribbon or something. PROS It's freeThe girls moan when you click themI guess this game could finally quench someone’s thirst who has an ancient Egyptian God fetish CONS Pretty obvious the game was made to sell DLCDLC is overpriced (for a dollar it doesn't even change how the monsters look - just the outfit of your character who stands to the left and creepily watches you play this game)Grind fest Conclusion Skip over this one. If you really want to play a Sakura game, check any of the other Visual Novel ones out or wait for Sakura Fantasy Chapter 2. ",0,hate

I suppose if I played this when I was 14 I would be turned on.

Ever cat girl meowed, which was repulsive. Speaking of repulsive, i have never been so flacent in my life. My little guy litterally receeded back inside me. At one point I think one of the monster girls said hentai, and i didn't know how to fell about that (sexually and emotionally). At this point you're probably asking, ""What made you play this game in the first place!?!?! Did u do it just to ♥♥♥♥♥?!?!"" that is part of it. The other half was, I was desperate. My wife left me and took the kids. She is now ♥♥♥♥ing the pastor at the local Protestant church. I saw it come up as a recomended game.

I even stuck my fingers halfway down my throat to get the pills out of my stomach so I can last just a little longer. And boy, do i regret it. I regret it more than marrying that ♥♥♥♥♥ of a wife.

418,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,"General Synopsis: A clicking game that simply takes time to advance and has no real goal other than something to check up on in the background every now and then.Difficulty: 0 (of 10)Cost: Free (has extras you can pay for)Good: -No learning curve as long as you speak English. -Something resembling a tech tree / strategy of sorts with the ""Ancients"" you can acquire over time.-Very low resource hog, no matter how far along you get-Runs in the background so you advance while ignoring itBad: -Susceptible to the Cheat Engine program for modifications (good to ruin what satisfaction you COULD get or to test higher levels on your system)-No real entertainment or excitement factor as you don't really have to /do/ anything-If you Google it, you can find a cheat manipulator to REALLY make the game boring-No end goal other than buying all the heroes and continuously leveling them and acquiring ancients/achievementsResults: As something to have running in the background, just for something to do every now and then when you check up on it, the game isn't bad. It's also something good to keep a very young child entertained for a few minutes before they get bored once they use up all the gold/money and then find themselves with nothing to do. As a game meant to entertain, no good.  But for what its intended purpose/type of game it is, is, it's a good play.Happy gaming,-Paladeus",1,neutral

421,Sakura Clicker,2018.0,"Product received for freeSakura Clicker is a game where you click on various girls (named and costumed like ""monsters"") to win and to get coins. You can click on any place on the girl. There's no difference in the results. With the coins, you can buy more levels and allies. The allies fight for you automatically. The higher levels and improved allies allow you to keep winning without having to wait forever for the enemy hitpoints to go to zero, as the later enemies have ever more hitpoints than the previous ones. They also have more coins. The enemies and looting appear in an endless sequence. But despite the millions you amass, some things can be only bought from the Steam store with real money, apparently. But the game developers have to earn somehow. Thats reasonable.Pros- Resembling ""Adventure Capitalist"", this game crystalizes the shallowness of the hack&slash  ""RPG"": you repeat mindlessly, some number increases somewhere ad infinum.- Revolutionary ""your damage only"" mode: the enemies do not even fight back.- The graphic design is pretty enough. The background changes now and then too.Cons- There are no cutscenes or adult content (unless you consider whats visible on the Steam screenshots as such).- You might expect the girls to lose clothes when you click on them. They don't. They wince and make a hentai-type exclamation or moan, often quite agreeable of having been beaten. That might be considered a plus, based on viewpoint.- The gameplay is incredibly shallow, you can mainly decide which ally to upgrade and when to hire.- There is no story. While waiting for that free hentai mahjong with some serious amount of serious sleaze, there are better things to do in life than 'play' Sakura Clicker, even if it is free.",0,hate

431,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"Some folks are going to hate on this because I like this game Unironicly. No, I don't consider this a Hentai game. This is a hentai game in about the same way that the moon is made of cheese. From a distance, someone uneducated could percieve it to be true, but it's just not. At most it's Ecchi, but the scantily clad anime women don't actually undress, pose in any manner that is remotely provocative, or try to make romantic advances on the player. The moaning and whining sounds risque at best, but you'd have to be severely innocent to be able to get an honest fap out of this game. Yes, the game does move at a slow crawl, but it's an idle game. It plays it's damn self when you close it, and then you come back to it. And you do other things. Nothing terribly new here. Some folks complain about a lack of monster variety, but I'm guessing they only played a few minutes, and never got to higher levels where things like dragon girls, harpies, and bunny girls start to show up. Perhaps the pacing for revealing new monster types is too slow for folks? It's meant to be slow. Found it fun to play while doing a lot of other things, which I am pretty sure is the intent. The different moans, while amusing, do run a bit old after a while. Thankfully there are options to silence everything if you want to. There are in game purchases, but they don't in any way affect the gameplay, which actually strikes me as a very honest free to play model. Buying outfits is not to enhance the gameplay: it's strictly there to support the developer, and you don't have to do it to enjoy pretty much everything the game really offers you.I'll probably unlock everything on this game over a period of a month or two, like with Clicker hero, before I get bored of it.The game may also have interesting updates in the future.

462,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,"As someone who is not a fan of anime, this was an odd experience for me.  I imagine a large amount of the supposed appeal for this game lies in an enjoyment of this particular art style.  However, I must evaluate this game based on the experience I had with it, not the experience the core demographic might have with it.  I do have a fair amount of time invested in similar clicker and idle games.  Based on that exposure, I can say with some certainty that this is one of the worst clicker games on Steam.First of all, the sound design (the audio of which I imagine takes up a large portion of the space required for this game) is grating, which is a shame, since the game's description proudly touts the ""included 800+ moans as you defeat the monsters"".  Despite the apparent variety of ""moans"", they all sound about how you might expect without even playing the game.  Why there had to be over 800 of these sounds which are almost indistinguishable from each other, I do not know.The music, which plays on a one minute loop (which is fairly standard for these types of games), is fine on its own.  They seemingly put in a lot of effort in the ""moan"" audio library, so it's odd that they didn't put that kind of effort into the soundtrack.  That might have been a plus, since one minute loops do get tiresome after dozens of hours.  The other sound effects aren't particularly special and there are no volume sliders.Secondly: the art style.  It isn't terrible, but I'm not a fan of it.  A cursory glance at Steam titles with the tag ""Anime"" on them all seem to have basically the exact same style.  The women all look like they had an unfortunate slip into a shallow puddle of vaseline.Every one of the ""monsters"" are just anime women wearing fragments of clothing that suggest they are the creatures they are supposed to represent.  Anubis has dog ears and a tail, Bear has claws and a smaller tail, Boar has weird ears and a longer tail, and Aqua has...a sash?  Alright.  You might notice very quickly that the designs for these ""creatures"" are very cut-and-paste and uninspired.  I suppose the goal was to make the women vaguely resemble the thing the title suggests they should be without sacrificing their appearance, in which case I guess they did that fairly well.  I don't understand it, but I'm not exactly the target audience for this game.Third, and most importantly: the gameplay.  The gameplay is beyond monotonous.  As someone who has a lot of experience with these types of games, a good degree of monotony is expected, but this is just ridiculous.  In other games, when you progress far enough to ""prestige"" (or ""Rebirth"" in this case), you are given a certain amount of a currency which you can spend to unlock new abilities or increase the speed in which you can reach the point at which you restarted.  Sakura Clicker has a similar system, except considerably slower and less interesting.  Your first Rebirth will probably be spent increasing either your gold gain or damage done by 10% which is almost negligible.  Your second might give you enough to get another 10% and so on.  There is nothing added to the overall experience.I'm getting ahead of myself.  The main gameplay loop is to click on a ""creature"" until it dies, collecting gold which you spend upgrading your clicks or hiring auto clickers which do more damage for you, and repeat ad nauseum.  You can level these characters up, increasing their damage, and every once in a while hitting a milestone which gives a passive bonus like increasing their personal damage by 100%, total damage by 20%, or gold gained by 25%.  These are all well and good, but they are way too infrequent and the former boost is going to be useless by the time you can afford the upgrade.  See, these upgrades come at fixed intervals: levels 100, 200, 400, and 600.  By the time you can afford to buy 100 of the same character, their damage output is usually less than 1% of your total damage output even after the upgrade.  The only ones worth getting are the total damage or gold upgrades, but again, these are very infrequent.  Perhaps a dozen hours wasn't enough time to fully evaluate the gameplay aspect of this game, but if you've played a game for 12 hours and feel like you've ground to a halt even after multiple resets and you're making no tangible progress, perhaps your game needs to be rebalanced.  It seems like the developer tried to clone another popular clicker game and just stick his art in it, but didn't actually play said game.  That essentially makes this a shameless cash grab, and that becomes clear once you take a look at the 21 DLC options for this title.So if you're looking for a clicker game, there are much better entries out there.  If you want an anime game, I'm sure there are much better entries out there.  If you want both, you're going to have to be able to put up with a lot of tedium, but honestly, you'd be better off skipping this altogether.",0,hate
463,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,to describe this game i use one wordBORING!!!!not only does it not fulfill the tag of nudity unless you call very skimpy clothing nude. the games basic mechanics were boring there was nothing to the games design to keep your interest. there was about 20-30 characters that just repeated and their clothes changed colors occasionally i could remember.the only plus to the game was the characters were good looking anime chicks with changing facial expressions when you clicked and landed critical hits.,0,boredom
464,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,love how there was actually real live females that were willing to moan into a microphone for thisbut did they know what character they would be? because If I was that dragon chick I'd have been proud to do it XD11/10 would click my dragon waifu again,1,love
465,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,Yet another Clicker game without any special appeal. Nothing that sets it apart from say Clicker Heroes in a good way. You'll enjoy it if you're a horny teen who hasn't figured out where to access actual Hentai yet.,0,boredom
466,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"the sakura games are pretty nice VNs but this one is just a clicker copy and a bad one.i had to actually play it for 5 minutes to review it , i just want to warn people its a waste time. and it kinda sucks many weebs will rate any anime game with♥♥♥♥♥♥a 10/10. back then on steam an anime game was a rarity, so any anime game was like a gem to be able to play it on steam and get backgrounds for it. there wasnt much out there,but i think we reached that point where theres enough already.in short the game is very boring,i played it for 2 minutes and couldnt review it,so i left it idle for another 3 minutes just to give it a bad score.",0,hate
467,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,To the idiots who are posting negative reviews i just have this to say. Why are you surprised that a game called Sakura CLICKER is nothing but a clicker? Wtf did you expect? And no the nudity tag isn't misleading because the devs made a patch to add it in since Steam won't let them have it right outta the gate.Anyway there's nothing wrong with the game and it's free so it's not like you paid for it. If you did then I would have a problem.,1,anger
468,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"I don't know if Clicker Heroes is the first game of that kind, but it certainly is my first, so I consider it as it and compare all the other games to it.If there's one thing done right there, beside the many things, is that it feels honest to you: you never feel cheated on because everything's mathematically correct.Sakura Clicker feels like a rushed game because of many reasons but the progress is certainly one of the worst. You feel like the developers just tried something to see how it goes, without putting much thinking into it.Most of the game is a copy/paste of Clicker Heroes (ascensions included) but with all of the functional changes done wrong.This ends up in upgrade cost being too high for the damage dealt, so the only good thing to do is to upgrade each ally 3 to 5 times then wait to buy the next one, and that wait means close the game and come back later. I know that happens to Clicker Heroes too, but here I mean literally play 2 minutes then idle for 5 hours or more. All the time.Since the aug 3rd update this situation got better, because the devs raised the damage a great lot, but that also proves the fact that this whole thing was just badly planned at the beginning, and it still doesn't feel right.This game suffer from many problems, and even though the devs seem to listen to the players and actually implement stuff that most people are asking, that could have be done before releasing it, and anyway we're far from something working right.It all feels like a cardboard game, with little to no animations (the only one being the enemies closing their eyes when beaten), just a few 8-bit like sound effects, and a short looping music that will get annoying very soon. The character design is nice but  it is just an excuse to attract people, because that's really the only good thing of this game.That said, those girls are just random, and there doesn't seem to be any pattern in their dressing. Bosses are just the same girls, but stronger.Your character is shown on the playfield, and you can change its appearance in a specific tab of the game. Most stuff has to be purchased with real-world money before being able to wear it (like the most sexy dresses), and that's the only thing you can purchase. The problem is that it just stand there doing nothing, so it doesn't really make sense to even be there.This game really feels like a quick cash-grab as there's nothing interesting to do while it runs beside purchasing upgrades, which, as I said, isn't really anything strategical since you just purchase the best ally and forget about the rest, so for most of the time you'll just have the game closed collecting money for you.The progress is non-existant as you can't really see any beside the small number indicating the level, because the game is always the same: random girls with a new random background every 10 levels.The worst thing about this game, though, is that you don't know where you are going.On Clicker Heroes you always have a clear objective, which isn't only to get further than your last ascension but it also gives you some clear short/mid/long range objectives to achieve and a little bonus if you manage to complete them, which are the in-game achievements. You have a reason to go further and a clear objective, and you also see an ending point to reach.In this game you don't have any. You just beat these always-the-same enemies for no reason at all, forever.Reaching further bosses has no meaning either, as they are simply another randomly-dressed girl which gives you nothing more than some coin, as all the other enemies.I see it as if this game tried to be another clicker with its own identity, but this new identity failed to be attractive and don't even work right.",0,sadness

472,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"Sakura Clicker made me feel funny, I guess.You know god damn well why you downloaded this game.You see, I have a love/hate relationship with Winged Cloud.

But then they do this thing where every point of view character irks me at a spiritual level.See, I'm no♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was only the Sex Offender world champion from 1975 to 1999. That being said, when women are pretty much rubbing their used panties against your face, I think you have the go ahead.  See, what Sakura clicker does right is that it just kind of gets rid of that fool they force you to learn about in their other products. This time they replaced the self insert male character surrounded by cute girls by making said character a cute girl. The game is a clicker, as it says in the title. What you do is click on ""monsters"" until they're defeated so you can make gold to recruit more heroes to help you fight said monsters. Considering how the monsters react to your attacks I assume that spanking is involved in some way. There really isn't much to say about the game other than this. There's a little bit of customization that you can do to your avatar. I added cat ears and a tail to mine so that says something about me. Sakura Clicker isn't for me. I see the appeal in clicker games, and cute monster girls can really take something like this so far for me. My enjoyment of this game was directly tied to the condition of my doodle. Do you enjoy clickers? Then by all means, go nuts. Do you enjoy cute girls with cat ears? Well this will keep your attention for a little bit longer. Other than that, play about 30 minutes, write a fan fiction about the events, make a mess of your keyboard, have yourself a good ol time.

476,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,"This is an interesting concept. I'm still not completely sure of the point, besides upgrading yourself and getting allies, and clicking as many times as possible. Also, the Trading Card feature is... odd. As a Free-to-Play game, trading cards are only awarded for spending money in game. There are... not enough DLC content to acquire the usual half you should. Considering that it takes $9 to earn one.Still, it is a good time waster, and it is free (at least at the basic model).",1,fun
477,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,"TL:DR The new update annihilated the game, don't waste your time until the positive reviews start coming back.The long version is that the game had some minor balancing issues, it played less like a clicker game and more like a macro game until you got to higher zones, when finally your clicks mattered to how much damage you'd do. Additionally, Attack Speed was a little broken since (as far as I know from how far I got into the game, about zone 40-45) you could only get attack speed with Spirits, so you'd spend your spirits on Attack Speed and get Damage and Gold Gain from leveling your girls to level 200, 400 or 600.Taking this minor balancing issue into consideration, the devs decided to murk the entire game and put it into an unplayable state, your clicks matter more and you're able to use an ability to essencially get 100% crit chance (crits now do x10 damage instead of x2, HOWEVER the ability takes 30 minutes to refresh) but now leveling the girls gives barely any damage, and your click damage in the mid to late game is dependant on the damage of your girls (You gain a % of their damage towards your clicks). It now takes hours to defeat some of the earlier bosses that you'd previously be able to beat your first or second try after collecting a small amount of gold.The only positive thing I can say is that it's nice that the damage your girls deal to the enemy isn't 'chunky' anymore, and now the enemy health bar slides down. Legitimately the only positive thing I can say.",0,anger

NOPE, links to the store, still nothing.Until or unless the trading cards are relabeled correctly as ""collector items"" specifically for this game, I can only come to the conclusion that Steamworks have been scammed into promoting this with certain features to get money for themselves and whomever they allowed booster ability.Unless you're a fan of the artist or clicker hero type games, which you honestly could be going elsewhere for anyway, this is the absolute WORST form of begging I've seen.Don't offer trading cards when you can't unlock booster.

Clearly, people have booster capability and the developer is ignoring questions on how others may also obtain it.Not being able to unlock booster while others obviously have seals the deal, I know a racket when I see one, but just when you thought broken and discontinued items on steam were bad enough, this is clearly misadvertised as having ""trading cards"" when the low amount and high prices for the cards AND BOOSTERS clearly screams some of somebodies buddies were given the feature so they can sell the cards while others weren't.
